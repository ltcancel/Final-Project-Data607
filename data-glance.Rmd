## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(emojifont)
df <- data.frame(
    x = rep(seq(2, 15, 6.5), 2),
    y = c(rep(6.5, 3), rep(2,3)),
    h = rep(4.25, 6),
    w = rep(6.25, 6),
    value = c("150K",
             "5",
             "> 44K",
             "260+",
             "2",
             "+21"),
    info = c("News articles from Kaggle",
             "News outlets tested",
             "Classified news ISOT data",
             "Articles from the Onion",
             "True/Fake trained models",
             "Functions written"),
    shape = c(fontawesome(search_fontawesome("chart")),
              emoji("athletic_shoe")),
    font_family = c(rep("fontawesome-webfont", 5),
                    "EmojiOne"),
    color = factor(1:6)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, height = h, width = w, label = info)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = color)) +
    geom_text(color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 10,
              aes(label = value, x = x - 2.9, y = y + 1), hjust = 0) +
    geom_text(color = "white", fontface = "bold",
              aes(label = info, x = x - 2.9, y = y - 1), hjust = 0) +
    coord_fixed() +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual",palette = "Dark2") +
    geom_text(size = 20, aes(label = shape, family = font_family,
                             x = x + 1.5, y = y + 0.5), alpha = 0.25) +
    theme_void() +
    guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
