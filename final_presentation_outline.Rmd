## Intro

<explain the real/fake news paradox, identify problems with the framing>
<state our approach>

## Data
<identify where our data comes from>
<show a snip of the data>

## Tidying
<example of how data is turned into a corpus>

<example of how we can reorganize two corpus into same structure for entry into randomForest>

## Training a model

<show example of how we train>
<example of a confusion matrix>

## Analysis

<identify main tracts of analysis>
  -fakeReal and onionReal on data excluded from training
  -models on eachothers data, helps us gauge accuracy on labeled data (maybe find another source of fake/true)
<analysis of biggest variables in each category, wordcloud?>

## Exploratory usage of our models

<identify how out of line realFake is with our preconceptions>
<identify how onionReal does on all_the_news>
<talk about reasons why, overfitting?>
<rerurn realFake with less variables and check>
<centerfold highlight mega graph of all_the_news plots in order>
