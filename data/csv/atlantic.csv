73378,"Updated on January 6, 2017, Billionaireâ€™s Row. All the Presidentâ€™s Generals. The Congressional Cabinet.   Donald Trump has assembled a    that has plenty of money, plenty of military expertise, and plenty of time in politics â€”  but not much experience in the sprawling federal departments they have been tapped to run. Trump has, thus far, chosen five wealthy business leaders, two generals, and four Republican politicians for his Cabinet. All but two are white, all but two are men, and just one â€”  Elaine Chao â€”  has run a federal agency before. Now they all must navigate the gauntlet of the U. S. Senate, where a slim Republican majority and an aggressive Democratic opposition will determine whether they get the jobs for which theyâ€™ve been nominated. The Senate hasnâ€™t formally rejected a Cabinet pick since it voted down President George H. W. Bushâ€™s nomination of John Tower for defense secretary in 1989. But no new president has gotten all of their nominees confirmed in the last 30 years those that become enmeshed in controversy or partisan brinkmanship (itâ€™s often both) usually withdraw before a vote. Trump may have more luck with the Senate than his immediate predecessors, and he has Democrats to thank. When they held the majority in 2013, they changed the rules so that   nominations are no longer subject to the   threshold for filibusters. That means Trump could conceivably win Senate approval of his entire Cabinet without a single Democratic vote. But even without the filibuster threat, Republicans have just a   majority, and three GOP defectors could join unified Democrats in thwarting a nominee. The confirmation process begins in earnest this week, as seven of Trumpâ€™s top nominees are scheduled to testify in Senate hearings. They include two of the most important Cabinet posts: Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, and Rex Tillerson, Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of state. The mere scheduling of hearings has sparked a fight between the parties. Democrats are accusing Republicans of trying to rush Trumpâ€™s Cabinet into office without proper vetting, particularly in the case of the wealthy executives who have slim public records and a greater potential for conflicts of interest. Just three of the nominees have completed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements â€”  traditionally a prerequisite for confirmation hearings. Democrats are also upset that Republicans have scheduled six hearings for a single day, Wednesday they believe itâ€™s an attempt to dilute media coverage of the hearings and make it easier for the nominees to avoid a major controversy. Late last week, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to senators that the Republican hearing schedule was â€œof great concernâ€ and was causing â€œundue pressureâ€ for the relatively small federal agency responsible for processing presidential appointees and nominees. Walter Schaub, director of the OGE, warned that the Senate would be breaking longstanding precedent by scheduling hearings nominees before some had signed financial disclosure forms and signed ethics agreements. â€œI am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before thenominee had completed the ethics review process,â€ Schaub wrote. Check back here throughout January and February as we update each Cabinet pick through confirmation hearings, committee consideration, and ultimately the final votes on the Senate floor. Department of State, Trumpâ€™s pick: Rex Tillerson, Background: Heâ€™s an oil executive. Tillerson has been the CEO of Exxon Mobil for the last decade after working his way up the ranks since 1975. Itâ€™s the only company Tillerson has ever known the Texas native started at Exxon after graduating college. Heâ€™s also an Eagle Scout who served as a past president of the Boy Scouts of America. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Heâ€™s a   businessman who makes big deals â€”  including with the same foreign governments with whom heâ€™ll have to engage as secretary of state. â€œThe thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments,â€ Trump tweeted. Liabilities: Tillersonâ€™s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin will be the biggest potential obstacle to his confirmation by the Senate. In 2012, Putin awarded him the â€œOrder of Friendshipâ€ â€”  a high honor in the Kremlin, but one that will not sit well with Russia hawks in Congress. Chances at Senate confirmation: Dicey. A number of Senate Republicans are worried about Tillersonâ€™s coziness with Putin, including Marco Rubio, John McCain, and Chuck Grassley. Rubio said he was â€œseriously concernedâ€ about Tillerson, and he is significant as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee that will hold the first vote on his nomination. With Democrats expected to oppose Tillerson en masse, the opposition of just three Republicans could sink his nomination. He benefits from the support of the Republican leadership, and endorsements from Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates and James Baker. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Department of the Treasury, Trumpâ€™s pick: Steven Mnuchin, Background: Heâ€™s a banker. Specifically, Mnuchin is a former senior executive at Goldman Sachs and a hedge fund manager who bought the failed mortgage lender IndyMac from the government in 2009. He spun it off into OneWest and sold it for a huge profit five years later. Mnuchin is also a Hollywood producer whose credits include Avatar, American Sniper, and the   movies. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Spot the pattern yet? Heâ€™s a successful businessman. But perhaps equally as important, Mnuchin was a relatively early convert to the Trump cause and joined the campaign as national finance chairman back in April, just as the Republican was shifting from relying on his own funds to setting up a more traditional fundraising apparatus. Mnuchin made clear early on he wanted the Treasury job, and Trump rewarded him. Liabilities: Goldman Sachs and foreclosures. Economic populists will see Mnuchinâ€™s nomination by a candidate who ran against Wall Street and the â€œriggedâ€ system as the ultimate betrayal. If Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for the speeches she gave to Goldman Sachs, how can he turn around and pick a man who got rich there for treasury secretary? Moreover, while Trump hailed Mnuchin for his business savvy in making a boatload off IndyMac at the depth of the Great Recession, Democrats will savage him for the foreclosures that resulted and highlight stories like that of an    widow who blamed hounding by the bank for her husbandâ€™s death. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. This is a fight Democrats are eager to have, since it buttresses their early critique of Trump as a con artist who ran on populism but plans to govern by oligarchy. Yet Senate Republicans are by and large a   bunch, and itâ€™s not clear that Mnuchinâ€™s critics can persuade three or more GOP senators to join them in opposition. Those to watch include Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Dean Heller of Nevada, who sits on the Finance Committee and is up for reelection in 2018. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Defense, Trumpâ€™s pick: General James Mattis, Background: Mattis is a   Marine Corps general who led U. S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013. He commanded forces in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars after the   terrorist attacks. Mattis also worked with General David Petraeus to produce the field manual on battling counterinsurgents in Iraq. Government experience:   years in the military, though none in civilian posts. Why Trump likes him: For a guy who once said he probably knows â€œmore about ISIS than the generals do,â€ he certainly likes hiring them for top positions. Mattis is known as a   and a voracious reader, and Trump has gushed that he is â€œthe closest thing to George Patton that we have. â€ Like Trump, Mattis is someone whose blunt talk occasionally crashes through the line of political correctness, and he has criticized the Obama administration stance toward Iran and its strategy across the Middle East. Trump seems to value his opinion: He told The New York Times that he was â€œimpressedâ€ when Mattis pointedly told him that torture does not work, though it did not change the  â€™s support for the practice. Trump also seems fond of his nickname, Mad Dog. Liabilities: Mattisâ€™s more colorful,   quotes may get some attention at his confirmation hearings, including this piece of advice he gave to Marines under his command in Iraq: â€œBe polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everyone you meet. â€ But they donâ€™t come close to the kinds of things Trump has said, and he won a presidential election. The bigger issue for Mattis is likely to be concerns over the tradition of civilian control of the military and having a retired general lead the Defense Department for the first time in 65 years. Chances at Senate confirmation: Good. They would be even higher but for the fact that unlike any other Trump Cabinet pick, Mattis will need to clear a higher hurdle in Congress. Thatâ€™s because both the House and Senate must pass legislation granting him a waiver to head the Pentagon, since the law forbids military officers from holding the position of defense secretary within seven years of their retirement. Unlike normal nominations, that legislation would be subject to the   filibuster threshold in the Senate. But although some Democrats are likely to oppose that bill, the party as a whole is unlikely to try and block Mattis from being confirmed. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Justice, Trumpâ€™s pick: Senator Jeff Sessions, Background: Sessions has represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, building up a record as a staunch critic of illegal immigration and expanded legal immigration. Heâ€™s been a conservative all around, opposing the Obama administration at nearly every turn. Before his election to the Senate, Sessions served as a federal prosecutor and then Alabama attorney general. He might have had a lifetime appointment to the federal bench had the Senate not rejected his nomination in 1987 over allegations that he made racist comments and praised the KKK while criticizing the NAACP and the ACLU. Government experience: Extensive. He served in the U. S. Senate since 1997 and held public office in Alabama beginning in 1981. Why Trump likes him: Loyalty. In February, Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trumpâ€™s candidacy, and he has been a surrogate and close adviser ever since. Sessionsâ€™s top aides are working in the Trump transition and at least one, policy adviser Stephen Miller, might snag a senior post in the West Wing. Sessions has made his name opposing comprehensive immigration reform and citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and Trump adopted similar positions that helped vault him to the top of the GOP primary field. Liabilities: The same comments that derailed Sessionsâ€™s nomination for a federal judgeship in the 1980s are likely to be    at his confirmation hearings, as will the staunchly conservative record he has amassed in the Senate. In his 1986 hearing before the Senate, Adam Serwer wrote for The Atlantic, â€œwitnesses testified that Sessions referred to a black attorney as â€˜boy,â€™ described the Voting Rights Act as â€˜intrusive,â€™ attacked the NAACP and ACLU as â€˜ â€™ for â€˜forcing civil rights down the throats of people,â€™ joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan was ok until he found out they smoked marijuana, and referred to a white attorney who took on   cases as a  â€˜traitor to his race. â€™â€ Sessions will face scrutiny over how he intends to enforce   and   laws as attorney general. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Most if not all Democrats will oppose Sessions based on his record on civil rights and immigration, and his nomination might have been untenable were he not a sitting senator. But the Senate is a political country club, and members rarely reject one of their own. So while some Republicans will face pressure to oppose him and Democrats will subject him to intense questioning at his confirmation hearings in January, Sessions is likely to win approval unless newer damaging comments emerge in the next few weeks. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 10 and 11 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Department of Homeland Security, Trumpâ€™s pick: Retired General John Kelly, Background: The military. Like Mattis, Kelly is a veteran of more than 40 years in the Marine Corps, having served as commander of the U. S. Southern Command for the final three ending in January. The jurisdiction included South and Central America, as well as the military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kelly also has the sad distinction of being the   military officer to lose a child in Iraq or Afghanistan. His son, Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, was killed after stepping on a land mine in Afghanistan in 2010. Government experience: Four decades in the military, including assignments as a liaison to Congress. Why Trump likes him: Aside from being a general, Kellyâ€™s deep knowledge of border security and the challenges posed by illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America are likely the reason Trump selected him. He has warned about the danger of terrorists using known drug smuggling routes to send operatives to the United States through Mexico, which was a theme for Trump on the campaign trail. Liabilities: Kellyâ€™s military background will draw concerns from those who oppose Trumpâ€™s move to populate his Cabinet with generals. But he enters the confirmation process with no obvious red flags that could sink his nomination. Chances at Senate confirmation: Excellent. Democrats are picking their battles against Trump nominees, and they arenâ€™t signaling a major fight against Kelly. For the most part, they are relieved that Trump didnâ€™t pick either Kris Kobach, the   secretary of state of Kansas, or David Clarke Jr. the outspoken sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. Democrats might also be saving their fire in case Trump nominates either of them for a deputy post at DHS. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 10 before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Department of Health and Human Services, Trumpâ€™s pick: Representative Tom Price, Background: The deeply conservative,   Georgia congressman is chairman of the House Budget Committee, a leading critic of the Affordable Care Act, and an architect of Republican proposals to replace the health law. Before entering politics in the 1990s, Price was an orthopedist for 20 years in Atlanta. Government experience: Twelve years in Congress and another eight in the Georgia state Senate before that. Why Trump likes him: The two men donâ€™t have much of a personal history, but Price is a close ally both of Vice   Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan from their years together as conservatives in Congress. Price will be instrumental in working with Republicans on Capitol Hill to devise and pass a replacement for Obamacare. In the meantime, Priceâ€™s experience in federal health policy could allow him to begin dismantling the Affordable Care Act from the inside at HHS. Liabilities: Medicare, Medicare, Medicare. The biggest obstacle to Priceâ€™s confirmation is not his fervent opposition to Obamacare but his support for Ryanâ€™s longstanding desire to convert Medicare into a voucher program. Democrats will do their best to make his confirmation hearings a referendum on this plan, particularly since Ryan has said he wants to try to pass it at some point during Trumpâ€™s first term. Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Priceâ€™s ideological conservatism and his support for overhauling healthcare entitlement programs mean he is likely to gain very little, if any, support from Democrats. Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia will be ones to watch. But Price is   personally, and his relationships with Republican lawmakers as a veteran member of the House make his confirmation chances better than even. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Trumpâ€™s pick: Dr. Ben Carson, Background: The conservative former Trump rival for the Republican presidential nomination has no formal experience in housing policy. Heâ€™s a retired neurosurgeon renowned for pioneering a procedure to separate conjoined twins. But what Carson would bring to HUD is the personal experience of having grown up poor in Detroit. He has written and spoken extensively about his upbringing, saying that his hard work and passion for reading, along with the firm encouragement of his single mother, helped him to escape the poverty of the inner city. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Again, loyalty. Carson endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the presidential race, and though he wasnâ€™t his most effective surrogate, he stayed with him through the ups and downs of the general election. Trump lambasted him during the primary, mocking his childhood struggle with what Trump described as â€œa pathological temper. â€ The two have long since patched things up, however. Carson was pegged for a Cabinet post early on, but it figured to be the Department of Health and Human Services, given his deep experience in medicine. Trump and Carson do appear to share an     philosophy toward combatting poverty, where government programs play a smaller role than they do now. Liabilities: Experience, or lack thereof. Carsonâ€™s most formidable challenge may be explaining his own assessment of his qualifications to lead a Cabinet department, as explained by his spokesman, Armstrong Williams, to The Hill shortly after the election: â€œDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, heâ€™s never run a federal agency. The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency. â€ Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Republicans may be predisposed to support Carson, but how he addresses this issue at his confirmation hearings could be crucial to his chances of Senate approval. Democrats are likely to challenge him both on his lack of experience in housing policy and his specific vision for running the agency and combatting poverty. They will also force him to address the sharp criticism Trump has levied at the state of urban America and his misstatements about the crime rate nationwide. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 12 before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Department of Energy, Trumpâ€™s pick: Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, Background: Perry served     terms as the governor of Texas, succeeding George W. Bush after he became president. He then ran for president twice, failing to win the Republican nomination in 2012 and then again in 2016. His experience in   Texas would, on the surface, seem to make him a natural fit, but the Energy Department is actually more of a national security agency thatâ€™s responsible for designing and protecting the nationâ€™s stockpile of nuclear weapons. The last two energy secretaries were   scientists. Government experience:     terms as governor of Texas, a short stint as lieutenant governor, and eight years as Texas agriculture commissioner. Why Trump likes him: Perry is another example of a Republican who fought bitterly with Trump only to make amends. Early in the 2016 race, Perry was actually more confrontational with Trump than any other Republican. He gave an entire speech devoted to attacking him in July 2015, during which he said Trump was â€œa cancer on conservatism. â€ But Perry was out of the race a few months later, and he came around to Trump once he secured the nomination and campaigned for his election. Liabilities: â€œOops. â€ As Democrats will undoubtedly remind the public to no end, the Energy Department was the Cabinet post that Perry infamously forgot he wanted to eliminate during a Republican primary debate in 2011. The mocking, however, will quickly turn serious as senators force Perry to explain how he plans to lead a department that he doesnâ€™t believe should exist. As with a few other Trump nominees, expect to hear the words â€œfox in the henhouseâ€ more than a few times. Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. The â€œoopsâ€ moment will cause Perry some embarrassment, but barring another   gaffe, itâ€™s hard to see it blocking his confirmation. He should win strong support from Republicans and even a few   Democrats looking for a bipartisan vote. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Labor, Trumpâ€™s pick: Andrew Puzder, Background: Puzder is best known as the chief executive of the parent company for Hardeeâ€™s and Carlâ€™s Jr. the   chains. He worked his way up in the business world originally as a lawyer and general counsel, the position he first held at CKE Restaurants. Heâ€™s also a frequent conservative commentator and a critic of   laws and the Obama administrationâ€™s overtime rule. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: Heâ€™s been a â€vocal defender of Trumpâ€™s economic policies,â€ and shares a rhetorical style with the  . As brash businessmen, they seem like two peas in a pod. Under Puzderâ€™s leadership, Carlâ€™s Jr. has relied on   ads featuring women eating burgers in swimsuits. â€œI like our ads. I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think itâ€™s very American,â€ he told Entrepreneur last year. Liabilities: Puzderâ€™s confirmation will be a rough ride for a number of reasons. On policy, his opposition to a   increase will be a target for Democrats, who will argue that placing a wealthy executive atop the Labor Department is an insult to   voters who supported Trump. And his   comments about women could pose problems, along with reports that he repeatedly abused his wife during the 1980s. (The   Lisa Fierstein, has since said she regretted making the allegations in their divorce proceedings and said, according to New York Magazine, that Puzder is â€œa wonderful father, a great person, and was a good husband. â€) Chances at Senate confirmation: Decent. Expect Democrats to put up a big fight against Puzder over his position on the minimum wage and overtime pay as well as his lack of government experience. Portraying him as an    multimillionaire will dovetail with their critique of several of Trumpâ€™s Cabinet picks and the broader message they want to send to   voters. So far, however, Republicans have yet to break away, so Puzderâ€™s nomination is not in jeopardy. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Transportation, Trumpâ€™s pick: Elaine Chao, Background: As labor secretary for the full two terms of the George W. Bush administration, Chao brings more civilian experience in the federal government than anyone else in Trumpâ€™s Cabinet. Before that, she directed the Peace Corps and led United Way. During the first Bush administration, Chao also served as a deputy secretary in the department she is poised to lead. Government experience: Extensive: see above. Why Trump likes her: While Trump surely appreciated Chaoâ€™s deep experience in government and Washington, there is probably another factor in his decision to nominate her for transportation secretary: Chao is married to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and a man who will hold wide sway over whether Trumpâ€™s agenda makes it into law. In particular, sheâ€™ll be a key player in Trumpâ€™s push for an expensive infrastructure package that McConnell and his conservative allies are cool to. Liabilities: Virtually none. Given her government experience and obvious qualifications for the post, Chao might be the least controversial of any of Trumpâ€™s choices so far. Her selection even won praise from Vice President Joe Biden. Chances at Senate confirmation: What is better than excellent? It would take a scandal of seismic proportions for the clearly qualified wife of the Republican majority leader not to win confirmation by the Senate. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, Department of Education, Trumpâ€™s pick: Betsy DeVos, Background: DeVos is a longtime philanthropist and Republican donor and the former chairwoman of the state party in Michigan. Sheâ€™s been a major advocate for education reform centered on expanding charter schools and   vouchers. She led the advocacy group, American Federation for Children, that pushes for increased school choice for parents. The New York Times reported on her successful effort to kill legislation in Detroit that would have imposed tougher accountability standards on charter schools. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes her: Trump has shown that he favors plucking people from the private sector who will come in and shake up a government agency, and DeVos fits that bill. She has strong support among Republican school reformers, especially those who favor both expanding charter schools and vouchers. (Democrats favor the former but not the latter.) She is further to the right on education than two other women Trump interviewed: Eva Moskowitz, a charter school leader in New York, and Michelle Rhee, the former chancellor of the Washington D. C. public schools. Liabilities: Teacher unions will aggressively oppose DeVos over her support for unfettered and largely unregulated expansion of charter schools and vouchers. That likely wonâ€™t matter much to Republicans, but it will hurt her chances of winning broad bipartisan support. Conservatives who favor reduced federal power over education will question her previous support for Common Core standards and her affiliation with organizations that have championed Common Core. Anticipating that issue, DeVos has said that while she supports â€œhigh standards and strong accountabilityâ€ for schools, Common Core â€œgot turned into a federalized boondoggle. â€ Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. Key Republicans have already come out in support of DeVos, including the chairman of the relevant committee in the Senate, Lamar Alexander. Most Democrats will likely oppose the pick, but barring a controversy that erupts during her confirmation hearings, she should win approval. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 11 before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Department of the Interior, Trumpâ€™s pick: Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, Background: Zinke is a Republican member of the House who was just reelected to his second term in November. He had been expected to run for the Senate in 2018, but at least for now, heâ€™s headed for Trumpâ€™s Cabinet. Zinke served for more than 20 years in the Navy Seals before entering politics, earning numerous medals. In Congress, he has opposed the sale of federal lands but supported mining and drilling on them. Government experience: Two decades in the military and two years in Congress. Why Trump likes him: Trump was, not surprisingly, impressed with Zinkeâ€™s military background, and the congressman reportedly impressed Trumpâ€™s son Donald Jr. an avid sportsman who was influenced by the recommendation of the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Liabilities: Environmentalists immediately denounced the Zinke nomination, citing his support for mining and drilling and his skepticism about climate change. And a recent report in The Intercept alleged that he committed â€œtravel fraudâ€ while serving in the Navy   unit SEAL Team 6. But there were no other immediate obstacles to his confirmation. Chances at Senate confirmation: Excellent. Many Democrats will oppose Zinke over his environmental record, but donâ€™t expect a major fight over his confirmation. The party has a political reason for letting him go through: Serving in Trumpâ€™s Cabinet may remove him as a threat to challenge Senator Jon Tester in 2018. Status of nomination: Awaiting a hearing, Department of Commerce, Trumpâ€™s pick: Wilbur Ross, Background: Another billionaire, Ross is the chairman of a private equity firm that he founded and later sold. For 25 years, he led Rothschild Inc. where he made a reputation as a turnaround specialist who bought up and restructured steel, textile, and mining companies, among other industries. Government experience: None. Why Trump likes him: The two businessmen go back many years together and share a critical view of U. S. trade policy in the last two decades. Ross, who specialized in turning around manufacturing firms, served as an adviser to Trump during the campaign. Ross, the   said in nominating him, â€œis a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal. â€ Liabilities: Yes, Ross may have turned around companies, but at what cost to workers? He will get the Mitt Romney treatment from Democrats, who are portraying him as an    plutocrat who outsourced jobs and slashed benefits at the companies he restructured. Heâ€™ll also face questions over the 2006 explosion at a mine run by one of his companies, which killed 12 workers. Chances at Senate confirmation: Very good. Expect Democrats to paint Mnuchin and Ross with the same brush, but the bigger fight will probably occur over the bigger job, treasury secretary. Status of nomination: Hearing scheduled for January 12 before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation, Department of Agriculture, Trumpâ€™s pick: TBA, Department of Veterans Affairs, Trumpâ€™s pick: TBA, "
73458,"For years the National Football League has been the uncontested king of media in an age of fragmentation. But in 2016, it seems to have run into an even greater force for absorbing the nationâ€™s attention: a presidential election, featuring Donald Trump. After years of steady growth, the NFLâ€™s average television audience fell 8 percent from the previous season. After the election, the NFLâ€™s ratings perked up a bit, but were still    through the end of the season and even through this past weekend. The audience for Saturday nightâ€™s playoff game between the Detroit Lions and the Seattle Seahawks was 20 percent below first Saturday night playoff game of 2015. At best, televised football is no longer a growth industry, but merely a strong business that has peaked. At worst, this is the beginning of a period of steady decline for the one thing on traditional television that was never supposed to waver. Last fall, news analysts converged on NFLâ€™s diminished ratings like detectives at a crime scene. Was the culprit the presidential election? Or did a string of yawners on Thursday Night Football dilute the quality of the games? Was Colin Kaepernick making people mad? Were the concussions? It now seems that the NFL is the victim of two cultural phenomena, both of which have implications that are deeper than football. First, the atomization of entertainment has finally reached American sports. The Internet ransacked the music album by giving each song a download button and unbundled newspapers by giving each article a URL. But sports too are now the victim of  two kinds unbundling. First, younger audiences are abandoning cable TV and, therefore, live sports. According to Matthew Ball, chief of research at Amazon Studio, Americans under the age of 30 now watch almost 50 percent fewer hours of traditional TV than they did in 2000. More subtly, itâ€™s simply easier than ever to watch football now without technically â€œwatching footballâ€ â€”  by finding highlights on Twitter and on sports websites. Why spend four hours on the couch when you can get on with your life and catch the most alluring moments in 60 seconds in line at Starbucks? The second factor is what you might call the superstar effect. To sustain an audience of tens of millions of weekly viewers, the NFL is principally in the business of minting football stars, whose storylines they can follow week to week, like episodes of a favorite scripted television show. The proof is in the numbers. The few 2016 games that exceeded last yearâ€™s audience had the biggest recognizable stars and rivalries. Televised games with star quarterback Aaron Rodgers outperformed their 2015 counterparts, and this Thanksgivingâ€™s showdown between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins was the   NFL regular season game since the 1990s. Sports are not so different from film. What national audiences desire above all are heroes, compelling challenges, and sequels. But the NFLâ€™s universe of superheroes is surprisingly sparse at this particular moment. Consider a commercial proxy for the leagueâ€™s biggest stars: the players with the most corporate endorsements in 2015. In just two years, the list has been decimated with injuries, retirements, suspensions, and disappointments. Commercial king Peyton Manning has retired, and so has candy king Marshawn Lynch. JJ Watt is injured, and so is Tony Romo. Drew Brees has missed the playoffs for a third straight year. Eli Manning has been a   quarterback since the middle of the Obama administration, while Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson have been alternately brilliant and confounding. Tom Brady remains transcendent, but the league puzzlingly celebrated his transcendence by making him the first citizen to be prosecuted under Boyleâ€™s Law. Compare this list with the NBAâ€™s list of endorsement leaders. Basketballâ€™s established and ascendant stars (pick your favorite: LeBron, Steph, KD, Harden, Russ, the Brow, the Greek Freak . ..) are healthy, in their primes, and mostly playing for competitive teams. The Christmas Day 2016 matchup between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors matched the   holiday game in four years. If sports were stocks, the NBA, despite the smaller market cap, would be the consensus buy. Here is the bright side for the NFL. Footballâ€™s audience is older than basketballâ€™s and less sensitive to   and itâ€™s unlikely that theyâ€™re poised to abandon the NFL for any other entertainment on their cable bundles. The Fox News Channelâ€™s Sunday afternoon lineup is not quite  . Whatâ€™s more, if the NFL is in relative decline, it is still TVâ€™s champion in absolute terms. Even its average games attract millions more viewers than a Christmas Day bonanza for the NBA. So, one might argue that the NFLâ€™s woes are relative. But relative woes matter. Television networks and distributors have committed $50 billion to the NFL until the early 2020s. If audiences continue to sneak away from NFL Sunday, it could hasten the inevitable shift of billions of dollars of advertising to video entertainmentâ€™s future home on   feeds. (The most popular replacements for traditional TV, like Netflix, Amazon Video and HBO Now, donâ€™t yet accept advertising.) In short, the atomization of content is pushing audiences away from television just as the locus of cultural superstardom is shifting to basketball. Together it suggests that the NFL Sundays may have peaked as a cultural symbol of American entertainment."
73308,"By Heart is a series in which authors share and discuss their   favorite passages in literature. See entries from Karl Ove Knausgaard, Jonathan Franzen, Amy Tan, Michael Chabon, and more. Thereâ€™s a widely circulated truism that short stories should start with a   â€œhook,â€ a canâ€™   first line that foregrounds conflict right away. (You know the kind of thing: â€œOn the morning of the day my brother killed my father, I spent an hour unburying my truck from new snow. â€) But Emily Ruskovich, the author of Idaho, teaches her writing students not to grab at the reader so directly â€”  the technique, she says, tends to result in desperate, dishonest openings. In her conversation for this series, Ruskovich discussed Alice Munroâ€™s â€œThe Love of a Good Woman,â€ a novella that begins in the least flashy way possible: on the musty shelves of a local museum, with   descriptions of the objects displayed there. The dramatic plot includes a murder, a   the discovery of a body, a life destroyed by guilt â€”  but the narrative proceeds with great discipline, revealing its secrets carefully over time. Ruskovich explained how the storyâ€™s power, horror, and beauty derive from Munroâ€™s restraint, and how its central image â€”  a red box full of optometristâ€™s tools â€”  becomes a powerful reminder of whatâ€™s missed when we move too quickly to look closely.   Like â€œThe Love of a Good Woman,â€ Idaho is a murder mystery â€”  but the mystery is not who did it so much as so much as how, why, and with what consequence. The novel centers around Wade, an Idaho man who has lost both his daughters when his   Jenny, murdered one child, the other fled into the woods and disappeared for good. As Wade slips into dementia â€”  with catatonic episodes that can turn violent â€”  we, like his second wife, Ann, try to reconstruct, understand, and ultimately come to terms with the sorrowful events of the past. Emily Ruskovich is a graduate of the Iowa Writersâ€™ Workshop, where she was my classmate, and was a James C. McCreight Fiction Fellow at the University of  . Her fiction has appeared in Zoetrope, One Story, and the Virginia Quarterly Review in 2015 she won an O. Henry Award for her story â€œOwl. â€ She teaches writing at the University of   and spoke to me by phone. Emily Ruskovich: I first read Alice Munro when I was in college, and Iâ€™d never heard of her before. My professor, Deirdre McNamer, gave me a copy of her story â€œRunawayâ€ â€”  and when I read it, I felt as if Iâ€™d been unlocked. It wasnâ€™t that I had something in common with the character. It was that I had something in common with the story, with its very structure. Munro completely captured the mysterious way my own memory works. I remember going up to my professor, having no idea who Munro was, having only read this one story in a bad photocopy. I was just kind of concerned. I said, â€œI donâ€™t understand why this woman isnâ€™t famous. Does she know how good she is?â€ My teacher laughed. â€œSheâ€™s pretty famous,â€ she said. â€œI think she knows. â€ I donâ€™t actually recall the first time I read â€œThe Love of a Good Woman. â€ Iâ€™ve read it so many times, because I teach it in many of my classes. But every time I read the story, I find something new â€”  I become obsessed with some new discovery. The story is about a woman, Enid, who finds out that the husband of the sick, dying lady she cares for has committed murder. That plot, in the hands of a lesser writer, would already be interesting. But even though the plot of this story is intense â€”  there is murder, there is lust, there are secrets, there are many vivid, mysterious scenes â€”  the whole story, especially the beginning, is so quiet. And the quietness is where the storyâ€™s intensity comes from. It begins like this: For the last couple of decades, there has been a museum in Walley, dedicated to preserving photos and butter churns and horse harnesses and an old dentistâ€™s chair and a cumbersome apple peeler and such curiosities as the pretty little    insulators that were used on telegraph poles. Also, there is a red box, which has the letters D. M. WILLENS, OPTOMETRIST printed on it, and a note beside it, saying, â€œThis box of optometristâ€™s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance, since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens, who drowned in the Peregrine River, 1951. It escaped the catastrophe and was found, presumably by the anonymous donor, who dispatched it to be a feature of our collection. â€ This opening shows such amazing restraint. Munro is so confident in her writing that she never feels the need to â€œgrabâ€ a reader right away, which is something I think a lot of writing teachers try to get their students to do â€”  advice that often results in dishonest beginnings. This idea that youâ€™re going to lose your reader if your first paragraph doesnâ€™t contain something really exciting â€”  I just think thatâ€™s false. I donâ€™t want to be hooked or grabbed. I donâ€™t need to be tricked into reading a story. Of course, a story does need to have some kind of tension from the first line. In this case, itâ€™s the confidence of this mysterious voice, the assurance with which the narrator lays out these ordinary details. The mystery is: Why here? Why is this brilliant author starting the story in this seemingly straightforward way? I am grabbed by this beginning not because it is especially exciting, but because I trust Munroâ€™s voice. If she believes that she must begin with a   description of an item in a museum, then I am fascinated by that item because she is fascinated by it, and because I sense all that she is withholding in her attempt to be honest and straightforward. I trust her absolutely, and I donâ€™t think there is anything more important than that to a reader. Making Art at the Painful Margins, But the subdued tone here is more than stylistic. We come to discover that it is intricately tied to character, as everything in a Munro story is. If Munro feels that she wants to start a story in a very restrained way, itâ€™s because the character shows an immense amount of restraint. And though she is not introduced until many pages into the story, restraint is the defining trait of Enid, the protagonist. Sheâ€™s a nurse, which means she puts aside her needs to attend to the needs of others. Enid has this story she tells herself about who she is: She is the person who gives up what she loves because other people ask her to. Itâ€™s this romantic notion she has that seeps out of the cracks in her otherwise very restrained, very orderly and medical outlook on her life. Restraint is central, too, to the murder at the heart of the story. Rupert, the husband of the woman Enid cares for, is an extremely restrained person â€”  when Enid gives him a compliment about something his smart little girl said, he canâ€™t even acknowledge her compliment, though she senses heâ€™s pleased. Heâ€™s the kind of person who spends his life ignoring anything that is remotely emotional or uncomfortable, deflecting those things with idle remarks about the weather or the cutting of the hay. But we find out that, one day, he came home and found the optometrist, Mr. Willens, examining his wife â€”  he was kneeling on the floor, with his hand on her leg, and accidentally her skirt had been pulled up slightly above her knee. Somehow, this enrages him. Emotion just overflows in him, and he commits murder just like that. A lifetime of restraint builds up to the point that he has an absolute lapse of control. Munro describes the aftermath of the murder this way: â€œRupert jumped out of the chair so that it was still rocking, and he started picking up all the things and putting each one back where it went in Mr. Willensâ€™ box. â€ To me, thatâ€™s such a human response. Itâ€™s what most characterizes Rupert, this repression, this obsession with order. Here heâ€™s got Mr. Willensâ€™s dead body in his room, with   foam coming out of his mouth â€”  and yet, the first thing he does after that lapse of control is put all the   instruments back into this red box. Everything in him is entirely under the surface. And so, later, when Alice Munro puts a hatchet in that manâ€™s hands and has another character tell him that she knows all his secrets, the danger is so much greater. If you only read the story once, itâ€™s easy to miss that weâ€™ve been introduced to this red box already. But itâ€™s right there on the first page: â€œAlso, there was a red box,â€ with this casual little â€œalsoâ€ there, as if itâ€™s an afterthought. Of course, itâ€™s not at all an afterthought â€”  itâ€™s the key to an unsolved murder, even though we could never know that at the beginning. We can only sense it the quiet intensity of Munroâ€™s voice. The last thing we learn about this box is that Mrs. Quinn, Rupertâ€™s wife and Enidâ€™s patient, hid it somewhere â€”  Mrs. Quinn will never tell where. Yet, here, at the beginning of this story, we know exactly where it is. Itâ€™s in the museum, but how did it get there? The museum offers its own explanation: â€œIt was found, presumably, by the anonymous donor. â€ â€œPresumablyâ€: an   distant, museum word. Yet it contains the whole aching mystery of these charactersâ€™ lives, a mystery that the story is too perfect to outright name. Itâ€™s so hard to exercise this level of restraint. In flashier stories, I often encounter images that feel to me, ultimately, to be dishonest. Iâ€™m thinking of a story I read recently by a renowned author, that begins with a   narrator describing the drowning of his daughter. Sheâ€™s on a lake playing hockey, and the ice breaks and she drowns â€”  but the way that this narrator describes his daughter drowning is so beautiful. Thereâ€™s something about her hair drifting upward as she goes under, the hockey stick left spinning on the ice like a compass. These are amazing similes and descriptors. But I was kind of appalled, because this is not how a father would remember the drowning of his daughter. He simply would not use language that way. There would be absolutely nothing beautiful about it. The story was   and it was published in a great magazine, but something that Alice Munro never does is privilege language over character, or anything over character. This is something I try to think about when Iâ€™m writing â€”  there are times, definitely, when I feel like I have to cut back on what Iâ€™ve just written because itâ€™s not quite honest yet. In my novel, I wrote about an event thatâ€™s so shocking and ugly â€”  the murder of a little girl. I struggled the whole book with how to make clear what happened, the actual events of what took place, without the language being too direct as to be vulgar, or too vague as to be beautiful. It was a challenge to describe something so ugly and unfathomable in language that was both plainspoken and mysterious, while also remaining true to the voice of the novel, which is a poetic voice. I had to go back and exercise restraint sometimes, really struggle over certain paragraphs for a long time. The challenge is to word something clearly while also leaving enough room for mystery, to let things remain open and complex for the reader even if Iâ€™ve made up my mind. Thatâ€™s always very hard. At the end of â€œThe Love of a Good Woman,â€ Enid imagines that sheâ€™s going to tell Rupert that she knows he committed murder. In her vision of things, sheâ€™s going to lead him back to the police station and heâ€™s going to confess, and theyâ€™re going to kind of have this weird romance while heâ€™s in prison. I remember teaching this story, once, and trying to explain about open endings: Even though we donâ€™t get to see Enid follow through, the fact that she has made the decision to do what sheâ€™s going to do is an ending in its own. But then one of my students raised her hand. â€œBut Ms. Ruskovich,â€ she said. â€œWe do know what happens. Or at least we know what doesnâ€™t happen. â€ And she read out loud the passage from the very beginning, about the red box: â€œThis box of optometristâ€™s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance, since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens, who drowned in the Peregrine River in 1951. â€ And she was right â€”  though, in all the times that I had read this story, I never saw it. I never saw that the answer to the ending was in this little aside, right here in the second paragraph. Because if Enid had turned Rupert in, the local museum certainly wouldnâ€™t have had a sign saying that Mr. Willens drowned in the Peregrine River. We know, then, she did not do what sheâ€™d resolved to do. So how did the box get there? The only conceivable answer is that Enid  â€¦     well, I donâ€™t know, actually. I guess thatâ€™s why I love this. The closer you get to a character, the more mysterious he or she becomes. The closer you get to that red box, the more mysterious it becomes. When you start the story, the box is just an object sitting among other objects, covered in dust â€”  next to a horse harness and an old dentistâ€™s chair and an apple peeler. But as you read and   you start to sense the human history that can be told through these objects. Each one is suffused with a whole lifetime of compassion and secrets and suffering. And though Munro gives us the privilege of looking at one of them, the red box, the other objects are left unspoken for. Thatâ€™s very moving: you get the sense that you could write an entire novel about the horse harness, too, or the dentistâ€™s chair, or the apple peeler. The story itself is as   as its characters in the way that itâ€™s told, the way scenes are arranged, with no great attention at all paid to the most crucial of details â€”  even though those details are there, plainly, for everyone to see, infused with a mystery so profound that they can only be articulated plainly. Some of my students have even remarked that these opening passages are â€œboring. â€ And yet this beginning â€”  this distant, restrained,   beginning â€”  is the key to everything. Itâ€™s so honest. So real. The greatest mysteries of humanity are hidden in plain sight here, hidden inside of such   language."
73296,"Itâ€™s sometimes said that modern science spends too much time on the documentation of a new trend and too little time on the replication of old ones. A new paper published Wednesday in the   journal Science Advances is important just because it does the latter. In fact, it sheds light on the scientific process in action â€”  and also reveals how   denialists can muddy that process. Hereâ€™s the big takeaway from the new study: Across the planet, the ocean surface has been warming at a relatively steady clip over the past 50 years. This warming trend shows up whether the ocean is measured by buoy, by satellite, or by autonomous floating drone. It also shows up in the global temperature dataset created and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In fact, the warming shows up in both datasets in essentially the same way. This is important because it confirms the integrity of the NOAA dataset â€”  and adds further evidence to the argument that ocean temperatures have steadily warmed this century without a significant slowdown. â€œOur results essentially confirm that NOAA got it right,â€ says Zeke Hausfather, a researcher and economist at the University of California Berkeley. â€œThey werenâ€™t cooking the books. They werenâ€™t bowing to any political pressure to find results that show extra warming. They were a bunch of scientists trying their hardest to work with messy data. â€ Hereâ€™s why the finding matters: In June 2015, NOAA published an update to its   dataset of historical global temperatures. Thomas Karl, the director of the National Centers for Environmental Information, and his colleagues at NOAA explained in a paper in Science that the old database had a critical flaw. In trying to merge temperature readings taken by ships and buoys, NOAA had been allowing â€œcooling biasâ€ to seep into its numbers. In other words, NOAAâ€™s global temperature estimates had been too low, and its measurement of climate change was too conservative. With this newly updated data in hand, Karl and his colleagues found there had been no slowdown in global warming during the 2000s. NOAAâ€™s new findings disagreed with those of the U. K. Met Office, whose widely used global temperature dataset does show a slowdown in the 2000s. So: Was there a slowdown? This is an interesting problem of some scientific interest. Researchers have pointed to El NiÃ±o, to multiyear oceanic cycles, and to the   reforestation of Russia as possible explanations for the change. But hereâ€™s the thing: The slowdown, or lack thereof, never threw the larger phenomenon of   climate change into question. In fact, even among the most conservative estimates, the globe kept warming right through the slowdown. The overwhelming consensus of Earth scientists is that the planet is harmfully warming due to human industrial activity. Whatâ€™s more, if a slowdown did occur in the 2000s, it seems to have abated now. The previous three years â€”  2014, 2015, and 2016 â€”  have all broken the record as the hottest year ever in the modern temperature record. But this hasnâ€™t seemed to matter in public debate, as   denialists have found enormous success casting doubt on global warming by glomming onto this â€œslowdownâ€ debate. When the UNâ€™s 2013 assessment report on climate science said a slowdown seemed to have occurred, it dominated press accounts. That same report also found that global warming was real, quickly becoming irreversible, and that humans were more implicated in the phenomenon than ever â€”  but it hardly seemed to matter. It was the slowdown that made headlines. Perhaps this is why Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, siezed on the 2015 NOAA study. Smith rejects the existence of climate change, and he alleged that that NOAA scientists had â€œaltered the dataâ€ in their study to get a chosen result. So in late 2015, he issued a subpoena to the agency, demanding all emails related to the study. Several months later, he expanded the demand again, requiring all documents and communications that included the words â€œtemperature,â€ â€œchange,â€ â€œclimate,â€ â€œObama,â€ â€œbuoy,â€ â€œKarl,â€ â€œship,â€ and â€œParis. â€ During this time, Smith falsely represented the research on the topic. He said climate data had â€œclearly showed no warming for the past two decades,â€ which is not true. And when a new paper arguing for a slowdown during a different time period came out last year in Science, Smith said that it â€œconfirms the halt in global warming. â€ But that paper showed no halt â€”  it only argued for the slowdown. And its authors specifically wrote: â€œWe do not believe that warming has ceased. â€ There is no valid scientific debate about a â€œhalt,â€ but Smith seemed to be trying to manufacture one. The Center for Science and Democracy, a nonpartisan advocacy group for scientists in the civil service, said that Smith was harassing NOAA for doing its job. â€œThe use of a sledgehammer of a congressional subpoena to cast so wide a net is unprecedented and unjustified,â€ said Andrew Rosenberg, its director, in a letter to the House committee. In June of this year, Smith responded by issuing a subpoena to the Centerâ€™s parent organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists. The   said that Smith was well outside his legal authority, and it declined to respond. * * * Which brings us back to the new study. It finds that Smith was wrong: NOAAâ€™s results are scientifically defensible, and its global temperature records match those prepared by different means. It does this by comparing NOAAâ€™s record to all the smaller, highly reliable records that constitute it. â€œThe way that NOAA makes an ocean record is they take data from a lot of different sources, and they smush it all together into a single record. They do this so they can have a long, continuous record back to 1880 or so,â€ Hausfather told me. Creating a record from 1880 is difficult, however â€”  especially for the oceans, where there are no   weather stations. Scientists have to piece disparate historical records together over time. This is a typical problem in climate science, but itâ€™s typical that some of those constituent datasets impose slightly different biases on the data. Before the 1990s, most of NOAAâ€™s   records came from ships logs. Ships are tricky because they have historically measured the sea surface in different ways. During the   century, most sailors measured the water temperature using â€œbucket measurementsâ€: They hauled a bucket over the side, dipped it in the water, brought it up, and put a thermometer in it. More recently, most ships measure the ocean temperature mechanically through an â€œ  valve. â€ Ships pump water into their hull in order to cool the engine room, and a thermometer measures its temperature on the way. This can introduce bias to the numbers, though: Because engine rooms get hot,    readings are skewed warmer than the actual ocean. Thatâ€™s partly why, since the 1990s, the governments of the world have deployed a fleet of new sensors to measure the changing sea. Buoys, satellites, and autonomous sensors called Argo floats all patrol the ocean and measure its conditions. This has dramatically changed the makeup of NOAAâ€™s temperature record: Whereas 95 percent of NOAAâ€™s readings came from ship engine rooms in the early 1990s, 85 percent now come from buoys. The fleet has provided a wealth of new data for climate science. But it also provokes the central scientific question of the NOAA study. Given the same patch of ocean, a thermometer on a buoy will produce a colder measurement than a thermometer on an   valve. This introduces some bias to the record â€”  bias which, for years, NOAA never corrected. Think of what was happening in historical context: At the same time the oceans were supposedly experiencing a slowdown in warming, NOAA transitioned from mostly ships to mostly using buoys. The underlying ocean may still have been warming, but NOAAâ€™s record was diluted by thermometers inclined to be cooler and cooler. â€œThe problem was, NOAA previously was just sticking the buoy data in with the ship data â€”  and not accounting for the fact that the buoy data was about a tenth of a degree cooler than the ship,â€ says Hausfather. This was Karlâ€™s insight: He and the NOAA team found that, once this discrepancy was corrected for, the slowdown disappeared from their record. In fact, removing this discrepancy was the main focus of their infamous 2015 study. The team behind Wednesdayâ€™s Science Advances paper wanted to test this idea. Thereâ€™s all this disagreement over correcting for bias, they thought. What if you looked only at records that didnâ€™t need to be corrected? So Hausfather and his colleagues compared the new NOAA data to what they call â€œinstrumentally homogenous recordsâ€ â€”  that is, records created by sensors that did not change throughout the period in question. In this case, those sensors are   buoys, Argo floaters, and   satellites. What they found is that the   records matched the new NOAA global temperature records almost precisely. Almost all the   records showed that the   NOAA records had a cooling bias. They also showed a slight cooling bias in the more popular U. K. database. Specifically, data from the buoys and satellites agree with the NOAA record nearly perfectly. Those records are considered the most reliable, and they cover the entire period studied. The Argo data covers the shortest amount of time â€”  only 11 years â€”  so the authors used three different global realizations of the same raw data. Two of the three of those sets found that NOAAâ€™s data may have been too cool. The third â€œwas more ambiguous,â€ write the authors. And that means they showed no global warming slowdown. â€œThereâ€™s no evidence from a statistical standpoint that temperatures over the last 15 years have been warming any slower than temperatures over the last 30 years or the last 50 years,â€ Hausfather told me. The paper has been greeted warmly by the larger climate science community, at least so far. â€œThe laborious process in which scientists check and recheck their work and subject their ideas to peer review has led to another success,â€ writes John Abraham, a thermal scientist who studies ocean temperatures, at The Guardian. â€œThis paper is another reminder why it is so important to invest in the temperature measurements that are needed to create   climate records. We really need uninterrupted measurements that span many   if we want to truly understand the Earthâ€™s changing climate,â€ he adds. Itâ€™s not clear that this paper will end the scientific dispute over whether the early 2000s showed anomalous warming or not. But it should end any spurious claims that NOAAâ€™s updates were politically motivated. And it should refocus readers on the main point: Human activity is already warming Earth and causing harmful changes to the seas, ice, weather, and land. On that, climate science is in overwhelming agreement."

73280,"The term â€œthe economic man,â€ or homo economicus, is attributed to John Stuart Mill. It represents one way economists have studied people for decades â€”  as rational,   actors whose behaviors and actions can be modeled. But then came the psychologists. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are often referred to as the fathers of behavioral economics, for demonstrating that the human brain relies on mental shortcuts and biases in   which often leads people to irrational ends. Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002, for â€for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and   under uncertainty.â€ In 2011, he wrote a   book, Thinking Fast and Slow, about his research with Tversky. The pair might seem an unlikely subject for writer Michael Lewis, who wrote the bestsellers Moneyball, The Big Short, and Flashboys. In his new book, The Undoing Project, Lewis tells the the lives of Kahneman and Tversky, the friendship that ungirded their   research, and ultimately how that friendship unraveled due to physical distance (when the two took jobs at different institutions) and tension over recognition of the work they did together. I talked to Lewis about why he wrote about two academics, the impact of their research, and the 2016 election through the lens of Kahneman and Tversky. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation is below. Bourree Lam: Why you decided to pursue this book project about Kahneman and Tversky and their research? In the preface, you mention Richard Thaler and Cass Sunsteinâ€™s review of Moneyball, which pointed out that what you described in that book was essentially behavioral economics. But The Undoing Project also seems to me a labor of love. Michael Lewis: The reason I got so interested in the first place was just that spending time with Danny Kahneman was so interesting. I wanted to go back for more, without ever thinking that this was going to be a book. [The project] immersed me in him, and becoming immersed in him meant becoming very familiar with his relationship with Amos. Then I thought: I had this privileged access I had this combination of a relationship with Danny and a prior relationship with Amosâ€™s son, who was my student at [the University of California]. I didnâ€™t know he was Amosâ€™s elder son at the time, I just knew him as Oren Tversky, but I was very fond of him and we were friends. The Tversky family was willing to open up to me. The more I learned about it, I thought: These guys were for the ages. If you could have been a fly on the wall with Freud, or Darwin, or Einstein   â€¦     I thought these guys were a big deal, and nobody had told their story. I didnâ€™t have any doubts about the importance of the subject. What compelled me to do it â€”  though I didnâ€™t feel like it was naturally my subject â€”  was a feeling that if I didnâ€™t, no one else would because no one else would have the access. Lam: How much time did you spend with Danny? And when did you decide it was time to start writing? Lewis: (Laughs) You know, you stop counting. We first met in the end of 2007. We made a trip to Israel together. I went and helped teach his class at Princeton. Weâ€™d go for long walks in the hills of Berkeley when he was here three months of the year. I donâ€™t know how much time when you add it all up together, but enough time so that there wasnâ€™t anything I didnâ€™t hear three times. Iâ€™ve had this with subjects often, where they think Iâ€™m stupid because Iâ€™m asking the same question in a different way for the eighth time, just trying to see if thereâ€™s anything else there â€”  a memory, an insight â€”  and I could tell I was getting that way with him towards January of [last] year. There wasnâ€™t much left to talk about that we hadnâ€™t talked about 18 different ways. In the course of thinking about the book, I laid it out over a period of a couple years, it becomes clear what you need, what material is necessary. Once all the gaps are filled in, I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s much work left to do on the reportorial side. I just sense that I have the story in my head and Iâ€™m ready to write. Lam: The three pillars of the book are biographical stories about Kahneman and Tversky, the way their personal stories informed their relationship â€”  which led to their Nobel winning work. How did you see the balance and interconnectedness of those three elements, and what fascinated you about them? Lewis: Itâ€™s funny, I didnâ€™t think of the structure that way. I was telling the story of this relationship, but I knew I wanted to do something tricky with the structure. I wanted to cut out quickly into the world and show the ideas at play in the world. The book opens with 30 pages in a basketball front office, and my struggle was: How do I weave their relationship and the creation of the ideas together with the consequences of their ideas in the world? I was constantly struggling with, how do I jam the readerâ€™s nose into the fact that this is not just two academics in a room spinning   ideas that have nothing to do with anything in the world? How do I jam the readerâ€™s nose into the consequences, like life and death in the world, or decisions about human beings in the labor markets? That, for me, was the thing I just agonized over. Lam: What was it like to write about academics, and specifically these two? Lewis: I canâ€™t think of another intellectual project that touches as much of human existence as their work in such an interesting way. I think theyâ€™re very unusually important and relevant. If they were just academics, I never would have even begun this project. What drew me to them was the life of their ideas outside of academia, and that they themselves were constantly thrust into practical affairs by Israel. The fact that they had spent time on the battlefield, and were constantly kind of on call by the Israeli government and the Israeli military. .. Their unusual interaction with the world outside of academia made the story possible. If it were just two guys in a room, I never would have written it. Theyâ€™re constantly being stimulated by stuff outside of the academy. Much of their work is mocking the academy. Amos explicitly and Danny implicitly end up having very little time for their own field. They create their own subfield within the field, and then they go about poking holes in economics. A lot of their interactions with their fellow academics are   â€¦     itâ€™s not hostile but itâ€™s certainly ironic and irreverent. I also thought that possibly a lot of academics would benefit from every six years going to shoot at people and get shot at. Lam: Really? Lewis: Yes. I think that it sort of puts everything in perspective. These guys were never going to have time for petty academic battles, and they had a gift for avoiding getting sucked into them. Theyâ€™ve got the perspective of what people who are fighting actual battles go through. Theyâ€™re not interested in the little things theyâ€™re interested in the big things. I think they get that perspective because itâ€™s forced upon them, because this all might end at any moment. Thereâ€™s an urgency to their academic life, their intellectual life, that I think grows out of their experience in Israel. Lam: Can you say more about what you found interesting about the way their ideas reach beyond academia? A lot of readers know you as a storyteller of narratives about money or finance. How does this book fit into the repertoire of your work? Lewis: Some of my work, at least, is clearly exploring the weird things that markets do. They screw up the value of baseball players they screw up the value of   securities. Even the political book I wrote, I found myself drawn to a candidate the process had no time for because his type wasnâ€™t valued. So the distortion of value that goes on in markets or in peopleâ€™s minds directly connects up to [Kahneman and Tverskyâ€™s] work. Moneyball comes right out of their work. Why do professional athletes get so badly misvalued? Part of the answer is there are distortions and kinks in the minds of the people doing the evaluations, and these guys were exploring that. I wasnâ€™t interested in them just because I thought they helped explain some of their work, I was interested in them in particular because of the intensity of their feelings for each other. But thereâ€™s no question that in their work are ideas that I wasnâ€™t even aware had come from them. Iâ€™ve been obsessed since I left Wall Street with the problems of financial advice. I just donâ€™t understand why people take it. These guys have a lot to say about that, and they also have a lot to say about why people shouldnâ€™t take it. Their work on randomness â€”  how people see random sequences as not random and see patterns where none exist â€”  you see this everywhere. You see this in people getting a reputation for being really great with money, you see it in people getting a reputation for being really great at picking hits in the movie business, or picking baseball players in the draft. Many of the things around us have a random component a lot of luck involved. The human mind doesnâ€™t see the luck, it sees the pattern and this is one of their first great insights. Lam: Another one of their great insights is how predictable and systematic mistakes and thinking errors can be. Lewis: Thatâ€™s the very big idea that collides with economics. If the mistakes arenâ€™t systematic, then economics can ignore them. Theyâ€™re showing that weâ€™re hardwired for certain types of mistakes, so people are mostly going to make these mistakes. Then you have the beginning of a story where whole markets can go wrong, and this is what Richard Thaler picks up on. He thinks of them as having one idea: systematic error. That would be filtering it through the lens of an economist whoâ€™s dissatisfied with the   model in economics. I think they have dozens of ideas. So, back to your first question, about what got me into this. When I would go out for walks with Danny, this stuff just tumbles out of him. I thought, this is just gold. This guy is, and, even dead, Amos was full of all of these nuggets of wisdom that if you add them all up together, theyâ€™re more important than the formal work. Lam: Your work has been about market failures in different realms, so I have to ask, are you going to write about this last election? Lewis: [Laughs] I have to ask, should I? Do you think anybodyâ€™s going to want to read anymore about this? Everybody wants to know what happened. Everybody wants their dream explained, because everybody feels like they woke up and are still in this dream. I have no plans to write about this, I certainly donâ€™t have plans to write about the election. Thatâ€™s not to say I wonâ€™t. Now, if someone called me from inside one of the campaigns and told me, â€You know, thereâ€™s a part of the story no oneâ€™s ever told. Hereâ€™s all of the information,â€ I mean, Iâ€™d be   to resist it. But Iâ€™m not actively pursuing it. Iâ€™m more interested in what happens next. Lam: I do feel like people are trying to gain some insight from The Undoing Project regarding the 2016 election though. Lewis: Well, itâ€™s a market for a politician, but people have this sense that the market did something really screwy, and theyâ€™re not unjustified. Thereâ€™s a very clear sense right now that a lot of the people who voted for Trump may not have been voting in their best interests. It really seems like an irrational act to put this man in office, especially to people who didnâ€™t vote for him. And so people want to understand what was going on in the minds of these people. I did find myself listening with a kind of Kahneman and Tversky ear to what was going on around me after the election. But the first thing I noticed was how people undid it. You could predict, given their discussions, how the imagination works and how the undoing was going to get harder and harder. As Danny points out, when a tragedy just happens, itâ€™s easy to undo it. You start from the event, and the first thing that you can undo moving backwards in time and change the result, you change: So the FBI directorâ€™s email, or the ground ball that goes through the first basemanâ€™s legs in the bottom of the ninth inning, or the   kicker missing at the end of the game. This is all the same stuff. But then what happens is, the consequences of Trump pile up. To undo the election, your mind has to undo all this other stuff that happens as a result of Trump being elected, and you just stop doing it. It will seem quaint in six months to be talking about the FBI director and what he did with the emails people wonâ€™t feel that it changed everything. Thereâ€™ll be a sense that this was always going to happen, that we were always going to have Trump as President, that whatever happens will feel more determined or more inevitable or fated than it actually was. I was listening to that, this brief moment after the election where people appreciated that this wasnâ€™t a deterministic event and lots of things could have happened to prevent Trump from being president, but their minds fixated on just a couple of those things. I donâ€™t think Trump knows any of this. I think heâ€™s just making it all up as he goes along, but heâ€™s really   to being both a victim and a beneficiary of the [human thinking] mistakes that Danny and Amos point out. Heâ€™s pure intuitive judgment, and heâ€™s appealing to other peopleâ€™s pure intuitive judgment. Thereâ€™s no real strong rational argument heâ€™s making about why he should be president. Lam: But thatâ€™s why many people remain confused that he won. Lewis:  Thatâ€™s right. Heâ€™s saying, vote for me, trust your gut. If you look at what Danny and Amos studied, itâ€™s just that. Somewhere in the back of peopleâ€™s minds, when theyâ€™re trying to connect my book up to the election, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s in their minds. But I didnâ€™t write it because of the election. Iâ€™ve been doing this for eight years. I didnâ€™t see any of this coming. I didnâ€™t connect any of it to the election or anything like that, so this is just an accident."
73206,"As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama promised to embrace Americaâ€™s allies and extend a hand to its adversaries. As president, he has made remarkable progress in engaging longtime foes, restoring relations with Cuba and negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran. But the same canâ€™t be said for all the countryâ€™s traditional friends. Obama certainly strengthened alliances with Western European nations turned off by George W. Bush, and worked closely with other countries to fight ISIS and reduce climate change. But on his watch ties have frayed with several countries previously considered U. S. partners, including Egypt, Israel, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The bitter    this week between U. S. and Israeli leaders on Israelâ€™s settlement policy is just one illustration of this trend. These ties have frayed in part because of events outside Obamaâ€™s control, such as the Egyptian Revolution and, in the case of the Saudis, the American   revolution. Theyâ€™ve frayed because of the emergence in many of these countries of leaders who are personally and ideologically at odds with Obama. But theyâ€™ve also frayed because of the unique way in which the Obama administration has treated adversaries and allies. The prevailing logic within the administration appears to go something like this: Adversarial governments donâ€™t want what the U. S. government wants, so constructive relationships with them must initially be based on opportunities for dialogue. Eventually, sustained engagement may help produce or identify areas of convergent interest. John Kerryâ€™s Speech on the   Issue, â€œIn light of the Cultural Revolutionâ€™s horrors, Nixonâ€™s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable â€”  and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies,â€ Obama declared in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. â€œ[W]e must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives. â€ Such logic helps explain why Obama has said, in reference to the Iran nuclear agreement, that â€œyou donâ€™t make deals like this with your friends,â€ and why, during a visit to Havana, he emphasized the importance of diplomacy despite his many differences with the Cuban government. By contrast, Obama seems to believe that the United States and its allies should â€”  in an ideal world, at least â€”  share interests and values. When an ally acts in ways he disapproves of, Obama has been more willing than his recent predecessors to publicly criticize or marginalize it. Often this takes the form of Obama suggesting that while the ally ultimately wants what the U. S. wants, it is going about things the wrong way. Hence Obamaâ€™s claim that he and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte share a desire to crack down on drug trafficking, but that Duterte isnâ€™t doing it â€œthe right wayâ€ or his assertion that steadfast U. S. support for Saudi Arabia against Iran isnâ€™t good for the Saudis, even though they think it is or his advice, as a â€œfriend and partner of Turkeyâ€™s,â€  that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan avoid an   â€œoverreactionâ€ after a failed coup attempt. Nowhere has this tendency been more evident than in Obamaâ€™s relations with Israel, and specifically his longstanding disagreements with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nuclear deal with Iran and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Here, for instance, is how Obama defended the Iran accord last year: I do not doubt [Netanyahuâ€™s] sincerity. But I believe he is wrong. I believe the facts support this deal. I believe they are in Americaâ€™s interest and Israelâ€™s interest. And as president of the United States, it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally. I do not believe that would be the right thing to do for the United States. I do not believe it would be the right thing to do for Israel. U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed a similar sentiment this week in a speech on the   conflict. â€œFriends need to tell each other the hard truths,â€ Kerry argued, and the hard truth in this case was that Israeli settlements are endangering a   peace deal with the Palestinians. Thatâ€™s why the United States had declined to veto a recent UN resolution condemning Israelâ€™s settlement activities, Kerry explained: This friend, the United States of America, that has done more to support Israel than any other country, this friend that has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel, cannot be true to our own values â€”  or even the stated democratic values of Israel â€”  and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel, if we allow a viable   solution to be destroyed before our own eyes. And thatâ€™s the bottom line: The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the   solution. Thatâ€™s what we were standing up for: Israelâ€™s future as a Jewish and democratic state, living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. Thatâ€™s what we are trying to preserve, for our sake and for theirs. In fact, this administration has been Israelâ€™s greatest friend and supporter, with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing Israelâ€™s security and protecting its legitimacy. These critiques of alliesâ€™ policies may well be justified, but often they havenâ€™t produced the changes that Obama has sought. The leaders of many of these countries have expressed resentment about the American president telling them whatâ€™s in their own best interests. Israelâ€™s settlement construction and the Philippinesâ€™ brutal drug war continue apace Turkeyâ€™s president is as authoritarian as ever Saudi Arabia remains rigidly opposed to Iran. One possible explanation for this lack of progress is that, when it comes to inevitable disagreements with allies, Obama has occupied a middle ground between the relatively gentle public prodding of his recent predecessors and the unpredictable iconoclasm of Donald Trump. Trump, like Obama, has at times been quite critical of traditional U. S. allies. But, unlike Obama, Trump doesnâ€™t seem to be especially concerned about allies sharing U. S. values, or to expect allies to broadly share U. S. interests he wants to partner with Vladimir Putin even though he doesnâ€™t â€œhappen to like [the Russian political] system,â€ and he routinely accuses U. S. allies of exploiting Americaâ€™s generosity in pursuit of their own selfish goals. And, unlike Obama, Trump has suggested that he might seriously consider alternatives to these alliance arrangements should his criticisms not be addressed â€”  that the United States could, say, withdraw its security commitments to Japan or NATO countries if they donâ€™t invest more in their own defense. These positions have introduced destabilizing uncertainty into Americaâ€™s intricate alliance system. But they also played a role in Japanâ€™s prime minister hopping on the first plane to Trump Tower, and NATOâ€™s European members ramping up military spending, shortly after Trumpâ€™s election. Obama, on the other hand, typically pairs his criticism of allies with a restatement of his strong commitment to the alliance. This is the complicated legacy the president leaves behind. He has succeeded in forging deals with hostile nations after decades of estrangement, and emphasized the importance of collaborating with allies to address international challenges, while nevertheless leaving a number of allies feeling estranged. Itâ€™s premature to assess Obamaâ€™s tenure the bets heâ€™s placed will take years to pay off. But he leaves office amid signs, however faint, that Trump could be more effective at changing the behavior of some American allies than Obama, who often valued those alliances too much to jeopardize them."
73297,"On Wednesday, Trumpâ€™s transition team confirmed that the   will nominate Jay Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In recent days, Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, had emerged as the frontrunner, ahead of other rumored considerations including Debra Wong Yang, a former U. S. Attorney, and activist investor Carl Icahn. In a press release, Trump called Clayton â€œa highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law,â€ who will take part in â€œunleashing the   power of our economy by encouraging investment in American companies while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries. â€ Clayton is currently a partner at the law firm Sullivan  Cromwell who works with Wall Street firms on mergers and acquisitions and regulatory investigations. According to the law firmâ€™s website, Clayton represented large banks, including Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital, during the financial crisis. Heâ€™s also represented large financial institutions looking to settle   claims with authorities. The SEC is often referred to as Wall Streetâ€™s watchdog. The agency is tasked with protecting investors and maintaining fair markets, which can include everything from investigating claims of unfair trading practices to implementing rules and regulations to keep financial markets â€”  and those who trade in them â€”  safe. Thatâ€™s a large part of the reason that the nomination for the head of the SEC has been closely watched. During the campaign,   Trump said that his intent was to cut regulation â€œmassively. â€ In the press release announcing the intention to nominate Clayton, Trump added, â€œWe need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers. â€ Many expect that a   Trump administration will reshape the way the agency polices Wall Street, but it isnâ€™t immediately clear which specific regulations the new SEC chairman would scale back on, and how. One set of regulations thatâ€™s been mentioned is the   Act, which the SEC enforces, and which Trumpâ€™s team has promised to â€œdismantle. â€ Still, itâ€™s largely unclear what Claytonâ€™s stance on rolling back regulation would be. In the press release, Clayton echoed Trumpâ€™s sentiment that policy should be set to encourage job creation. Mary Jo White, the SECâ€™s current chairman, announced her plans to step down after the election, which isnâ€™t unusual during a change of administration. But there will be significantly more turnover than White. There are two additional openings on the   commission. (Traditionally, the commission is made up of two Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners in addition to the chairman.) And four division directors at the SEC have announced their departures in the past month, including Andrew Ceresney, the director of the SECâ€™s enforcement division. The exodus was largely expected after White announced her departure, but with so many empty seats, it opens the door for the SEC, and its new head, to be less tough on Wall Street banks."
73342,"By age 20, AB had suffered four concussions, gotten viral meningitis, and been struck by lightning. â€œSheâ€™s unofficially the unluckiest girl alive,â€ says Kevin Mitchell, a neurogeneticist at Trinity College Dublin, who published a recent case study on AB, a pseudonymous subject. Her series of unfortunate events also ended up producing a scientific puzzle. Because before all this, ever since she was a child, AB had been able to see colors with musical notes and perceive unique auras around people, the study reports. This mixing of senses is a   phenomenon known as synesthesia. Synesthesia can come in many different forms, including colors that evoke sounds, words that evoke tastes, or even sounds that evoke touch. For AB, each insult to her brain â€”  the concussions, the meningitis, the lightning â€”  altered her synesthesia in different ways, both subtle and dramatic. Her synesthesia eventually returns exactly the same as before it went away. No one had documented before such a case, where the perceived colors changed so much over time before returning to baseline. The brain is, weirdly enough, both malleable and unchanging. As a child, when AB saw colors with musical notes, higher pitched notes were pastel lower ones more solid. She could play by ear the tin whistle, flute, glockenspiel, marimba, and piano, perceiving    notes as the wrong color. And when she saw auras around people, their colors were determined by the peopleâ€™s personalities. She associated blue with loyalty, green with caring, red with power, and so on. But in her early teens, the study explains, AB had a couple of mild concussions that led to migraines. The prescription migraine medication she took erased all the color from her synesthesia for a time. Eventually, it came back. At 19, AB got viral meningitis, an infection of the membranes around the brain. For a month thereafter, she could see colors with musical notes but they would be the wrong colors. She again recovered. But then she got another concussion, which moved the colors she saw from the center of her field of vision to the side. Yet another concussion made the colors more intense but somehow off. According to the study, it didnâ€™t affect the actual colors she saw of objects in the real world, but the change in her synesthesia was still distressing. The colors AB perceived through synesthesia were as real to her as the colors of real objects seeing different colors with the same musical notes was like waking up one day to find apples blue. Things got really weird after she was struck by lightning two months later. This, understandably, increased her anxiety, and she started seeing strange colors like golds and silver along with colors that were possibly â€œnot even real colors,â€ she told the researchers. Xanax calmed her, but it also muted the colors she perceived. Later, when she started getting seizures, medication again completely suppressed the colors. Her synesthesia returned to normal the next year, and the colors she associated with notes and people were the same as before the meningitis and lightning episodes. Drugs can sometime induce synesthesia in   so the idea that synesthesia can come and go is not surprising. â€œItâ€™s almost in synesthesia folklore that synesthesia can weaken with certain types of drugs and depression,â€ says David Brang, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who studies synesthesia but was not involved in this case study. Whatâ€™s remarkable, says Brang, is that ABâ€™s color associations came back and remained consistent, despite all the medications and head trauma. In a second case also presented in Mitchellâ€™s paper, a man referred to as CD lost his synesthesia for eight years when he started taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder, only to have it return in full force when he stopped. Synesthesia has two competing â€”  though not mutually exclusive â€”  explanations in neurobiology. In one, people with synesthesia have extra connections in their brains, connecting for example their auditory cortex with their visual cortex. In the second, everyone has these connections between different parts of the brains, but theyâ€™re usually unactivated. These connections may be disinhibited â€”  as in   â€”  in people with synesthesia. The cases of AB and CD do not readily point to one explanation over the other. Perhaps the drugs and head trauma altered the wiring of their brains perhaps it altered which connections were active. Perhaps both. What the cases do neatly illustrate is the subjectivity of color, and by extension, of all our perceptions. If you can hear a note and see turquoise one day and hear the same note but see no color the next, then you have to conclude color is not intrinsic to the note. Even the color we see from real objects are our brainsâ€™ interpretations of wavelengths of light bouncing off that object. (Cough, The Dress.) Thatâ€™s why AB could report perceiving colors that were â€œnot even real colors. â€ â€œItâ€™s a really fascinating insight into how the brain generates internally a representation of a color,â€ and how the brain could generate it wrong, says Mitchell. For people with synesthesia, those colors they experience are also no different than the colors of real objects. Brang says he knows of people who stopped taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder because they couldnâ€™t stand losing their synesthesia. â€œIt actually worsened their depression,â€ he says. â€œThe loss of these color experiences had muted their world. â€ It was like losing a sense. â€œEach person has their own unique window into the universe. Synesthesia is just a remarkable demonstration  of that,â€ says Peter Grossenbacher, a psychologist at Naropa University who has also studied people with synesthesia. Some of us have just looked through more than one window into the universe, not by choice but through (mis) fortune, drugs, and head trauma."
73463,"Updated on January 11 at 5:56 p. m. ET,   Donald Trump announced at a press conference Wednesday that he is transferring control of his company to his sons, a plan that falls far short of what ethics experts have advised for the   to prevent conflicts of interest as a result of his business entanglements. The steps announced Wednesday wonâ€™t resolve Trumpâ€™s potential conflicts of interest, according to Norman Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Obama. â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s   course will precipitate scandal and corruption,â€ Eisen said in an   arguing that when he assumes the presidency, Trump will be poised to violate a provision of the Constitution intended to prevent foreign governments from buying influence in the U. S. government.â€‹ Later on Wednesday, U. S. Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub denounced Trumpâ€™s plans in no uncertain terms. â€œThis isnâ€™t the way the presidency has worked since Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act in 1978 in the immediate aftermath of the Watergate scandal,â€ he said at a forum convened by the Brookings Institution in Washington, D. C. The criticism Trump faces from ethics experts is bipartisan: Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, also criticized Trumpâ€™s stated plans during the forum. â€œThe plan we heard today is not compliant with the law,â€ Painter warned. â€œThe   has nine days to fix this problem. â€ Trump ran on the promise that his success as a businessman would translate into a successful presidency. But in the aftermath of the election, Trump has faced pressure to resolve potential conflicts of interest posed by his business dealings. On Wednesday, he explained that his â€œtwo sons . .. Don and Eric are going to be running the company. â€ He added: â€œThey are going to be running it in a very professional manner. Theyâ€™re not going to discuss it with me. â€ A lawyer working on Trumpâ€™s behalf, Sheri Dillon, elaborated on the  : â€œThrough the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump organization to his sons, Don and Eric, and a longtime Trump executive Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric, and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization, and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by   Trump. â€   Dillon went on to say that â€œan ethics adviser will be appointed to the management teamâ€ as part of the trust agreement, that â€œTrump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump organization entities,â€ and that Trump has created â€œa new position at the Trump Organization: the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses are operating at the highest levels of integrity. â€ Additionally, Trump will â€œvoluntarily donate all profits from   payments made to his hotels to the U. S. Treasury. â€ Dillon added: â€œThis way it is the American people who will profit. â€ Notably, however, the plans do not meet the criteria that ethics experts have advised: Trump will not sell and fully divest from his business assets or put them into a blind trust. The point of a blind trust is to set up an impermeable barrier between the person placing their holdings into the trust and the person managing the trust. By giving his sons and an employee control over the trust instead, Trump virtually guarantees that the buffer between himself and his business interests will be porous. Trump may insist that his sons wonâ€™t discuss the business with him, but there is no way for the American public to know that for certain. With his family members in control of the organization, Trump is far more likely to find out the details of business transactions, even if only inadvertently, as opposed to if he had placed his assets into a blind trust. In Politico, Eisen, along with Painter and Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe, outlined criteria by which to judge Trumpâ€™s plans to avoid conflicts of interest. The article makes a series of recommendations, including that Trump should â€œmake a clean break from ownership of his businesses, not just operations,â€ â€œdivest into a true blind trust,â€ and â€œuse a truly independent trustee, not a family member. â€ Reacting to Wednesdayâ€™s announcement, Eisen emphasized that Trump failed to adhere to any of those ethical guidelines in outlining his new plan. â€œMr. Trump did not make a clean break with his   interests as his predecessors for four decades have done did not establish a blind trust or the equivalent as bipartisan experts and [Office of Government Ethics] called for entrusted trust responsibility in his family and a current employee, rather than in an independent trustee.   â€¦     And offered an inadequate and   ethics wall. â€ Dillon argued that setting up a blind trust or selling the business werenâ€™t feasible options on Wednesday. â€œSelling first and foremost would not eliminate possibilities of conflict of interest,â€ she said, adding that â€œif   Trump sold his brand he would be entitled to royalties for the use of itâ€ and â€œfurther, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutinyâ€ and questions of   . Dillon also argued that you â€œcannot have a totally blind trust with operating business. â€ In addition to the other ethics concerns he raised, Eisen argued that the decision to direct Trump hotel revenue from foreign governments to the U. S. Treasury fails to at all comply with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which legal experts have explained is intended to prevent corruption as a result of payments from foreign governments. Trumpâ€™s plan â€œdid not screen all â€˜emoluments   â€¦     of any kind whatever,â€™ as required by the Constitution, but only some revenues, and only from his hotels,â€ Eisen wrote over  . He elaborated: â€œThe Emoluments Clause doesnâ€™t only cover some hotel revenues, as the Trump team wrongly believes, but applies to a much broader range of   benefits that Trump is collecting, and will continue to collect, from foreign governments. On January 20, that will be in direct violation of the Constitution. â€ As a result of lingering ethics questions, Trumpâ€™s   press conference will not put to rest concerns over his potential conflicts of interest. Now, the question is how much pressure from Congress or the public Trump will continue to face, and whether he will see fit to take any additional action. Office of Government Ethics Director Shaub noted on Wednesday that â€œthereâ€™s still time to . .. come up with something that will resolve these conflicts. â€ He went on to add, however, that â€œnothing short of divestiture will resolveâ€ the potential conflicts facing Trump. Prior to Wednesdayâ€™s press conference, Pew Research found that a majority of Americans are indeed concerned that Trump will be exposed to potential conflicts of interest. If that concern does not lessen, the   may feel compelled to do more."
73418,"Many Donald Trump supporters have generously taken time in recent days to explain what the   would have to do to lose their support. So far, Iâ€™ve highlighted two emails that represent significant if opposing factions within the Trump coalition: an immigration restrictionist hoping for conservative Supreme Court appointments and a moderate who wants Trump to govern as a  . It will be tough, I think, for the   to satisfy both of those factions. Today I present an email from a different kind of Trump supporter. He represents a much smaller part of the Trump coalition. And yet, it is a part that depresses me, because my   correspondent has given up on the American experiment. Lest you think I exaggerate, Iâ€™ll let him present his ideas in his own words. He begins: Iâ€™m a   white male in my late 20s. Before I became a devotee of Trumpism, I voted for Ron Paul in both 2008 and 2012. I used to define myself as a Libertarian, but have intellectually drifted away from it. These days, Iâ€™m probably better defined as a   with a fondness for the writings of Nick Land and the political economy of Lee Kuan Yew.  To answer the question as to why I would support Trump and how he could break my support, I think itâ€™s important to step back and consider the broader context of Trumpâ€™s rise. In the late 1970s, the assumption was that the Soviet Unionâ€™s system was effectively a permanent fixture in world affairs. Few would have imagined that within 10 years, the system that had looked so stable would collapse. The ideological boundaries it set for itself rendered it unable to address the crisis that afflicted its economy. We might have imagined 10 years ago that Liberal Democracy was similarly stable, but today, that looks increasingly less certain. This should be no surprise. Every social idea, every system, is born for a particular set of conditions, and dies when the conditions that permitted its existence no longer hold. Liberal Democracyâ€™s underpinning was very simple: no other system could deliver constant gains to living standards, widely distributed prosperity, and government which was institutionally capable. The alternatives had either been systematically destroyed and buried by history or collapsed upon themselves. The conditions which legitimized Liberal Democracy have now ended. Liberal Democracy, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has produced a crisis of underemployment, stagnant growth, systemic incompetence, and total declining living standards for all but a tiny minority of people who have reaped essentially all meaningful benefits from globalization. Here I want to pause for two interjections: My correspondent continues: In my view, Liberal Democracy has failed and no longer carries  any credibility for solving our countryâ€™s increasing number of problems. Trump is a messenger, however imperfect, of an alternative that offers real, serious solutions. As Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary, and perhaps the leader I admire most stated, â€œliberal democratic states canâ€™t remain globally competitive. â€ He instead pointed out, correctly, that the most successful nations since the end of the Crisis have been states which arenâ€™t liberal, and often not even democracies. Models like China, Singapore, Turkey, or even Russia to an extent, have delivered far greater gains in living standards to their population since 2000. Viktor Orbanâ€™s solution was democracy unconstrained by Liberal Institutional forms  â€”   a pure, illiberal democracy. Donald Trump is probably not academically inclined in the same way Mr. Orban is, but his vision is similar to what Viktor Orban has built in Hungary. Trump is not  . He is the voice for numerous people who despise the current â€œelitesâ€ and the systemically incompetent government they constructed. He is, if anything, a reintroduction of democracy into a system that was previously Liberal  . I urge Hugh Hewitt, Brian Kennedy, Charles Kessler, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and others in the conservative movement to read this next part carefully: I voted for Trump because I think his illiberal tendencies are actually a feature rather than a bug. When he undermines rule of law, I see not a danger, but someone who is undermining a system that has become a game for elites with access to armies of lawyers. When he browbeats Congress, I donâ€™t worry about â€œchecks and balancesâ€ which have become a recipe for dysfunction, but rather see him as a man taking on useless political prostitutes servicing everyone who can write a sufficiently large campaign check. When he   multinational companies like Carrier, I see someone standing up to the worst aspects of globalization. The masses of the people do not have anyone in government standing for their interests and need a strong leader to fight an elite that is both rapacious and incompetent. Rather than accept our system of design by committee, what is needed is a strong leader to clear away the policy kludges, rent seeking, and incompetence of the lobbyists and their pet legislators. By all indications, this is a minority view among Trump supporters, but conservatives would do well to understand that the   faction in their coalition is growing. My correspondent finally explains that there is just one way Trump can lose him as a supporter: The only way Trump can lose my loyalty is if he fails to fight the John McCains, Paul Ryans, Chuck Schumers and others on both the Corporate Right and Identity Politics Left who prefer fixed ideas and ideological navel gazing to national well being. If he takes them on, and can improve the living standards of most Americans, then he has my total support. The concern is not ideological consistency or respect for the rules. Instead, my concerns will be very basic. Does he improve economic growth? Does he reduce crime? Reduce unemployment rates? Increase average incomes? If he can do that, Iâ€™m happy. Bill Clinton presided over GDP growth, falling crime, reduced unemployment, and increased average incomes, even as the Republicans gained power in Congress and did their best to run him out of office. Why was that possible in our gridlocked system in the 90s, but now impossible within the liberal democratic framework? He concludes: I very much suspect that Trumpâ€™s desire to fix these issues will run headfirst into institutional stonewalling by the Liberal democratic system replete with its   interest groups.  If Trump decides to impose his authority on the system, he will have my support. But I strongly suspect that he will have to decide to lead the fight against the rest of the elites and their pet Congressmen, Senators, and the rest of the Deep State. If he does, I will support him. If he caves to them, makes peace with them, then he will lose my support. I feel some sense of sadness stating these thoughts. Liberal democracy is, in theory, a very appealing system. Yet looking at the economic ruins of Greece and the rest of Southern Europe, the   in the US, and the lack of sensible ideas being put forward by the political center, I no longer believe that it is any different from Marxism Leninism  â€”   a system doomed by its own optimism in human nature and ideologically too rigid for   success. Perhaps systems like ours are condemned to fall into Caesarism as a refuge from an alternative of Plutocracy. It seems increasingly inevitable. I hope to follow up with the reader, to suggest that he has far too rosy a view of Russia that China is a rather odd model of success for someone who purports to be bothered by   elites and unequal benefits from globalization and that he is rather stacking the deck by designating Greece as the representative of liberal democracies and Singapore as the designated alternative! What about successful liberal democracies from Denmark to Canada to Australia to Switzerland to Germany? Residents of   democracies seem awfully eager to immigrate to countries like that, as well as to â€œthe rest of Southern Europe,â€ for that matter. Again, if Spain, Italy, and France are what failure looks like, what a fine system! Or so I see it. Iâ€™d be curious to know how heâ€™d respond to all of that. Iâ€™ll return to   in future pieces. For now, I recommend Scott Alexanderâ€™s â€œ  FAQâ€ for those tempted by the ideology Will Wilkinsonâ€™s words on the urgency of revitalizing liberalism for everyone alarmed that a growing number of people seem to be tempted by reactionary ideology and Damon Linkerâ€™s overstated but   column on â€œthe stunning end of left and right. â€ If the future turns out to pit liberal and illiberal factions against one another for control of the United States, conservatives and liberals in the Republican and Democratic parties will need to cooperate. If liberal democracy fails here it will be because they were too myopic to do so."
73271,"When Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump, hope that the federal government might make the nationâ€™s public colleges and universities free dwindled. The Democratic Party faithful, among others, were dejected. Until now. In a sign that   higher education could continue to expand in a more piecemeal fashion, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a plan on Tuesday to offer   degrees at the stateâ€™s public colleges and universities for residents from families earning less than $125, 000 a year. The idea is significant in part because New York is home to the nationâ€™s largest   system â€”  serving some 440, 000 students â€”  and the plan, which will need to be approved by state lawmakers, could affect 940, 000 families with   children, according to the governorâ€™s office. Whatâ€™s more, Cuomo â€”  a Democrat â€”  and other advocates hope that if New York successfully makes   college a statewide reality, then other states will follow. Bernie Sanders, Clintonâ€™s main Democratic challenger during the presidential primaries and a vocal advocate of   public colleges, joined Cuomo, who is reported to be considering a run for president in 2020. The pair explained the proposal in remarks at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. The days when a person could graduate from high school and count on a   manufacturing job â€œare over,â€ Sanders said. In the current economy, â€œyou need a college education, if youâ€™re going to compete. â€ Despite Trumpâ€™s   promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, research from Anthony Carnevale, the head of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University, and others back up the idea that college is still generally a solid investment. People with college degrees still earn more than those without them, and   are less likely to be unemployed as more jobs than ever require a degree. But, Cuomo said, rising college costs and the need for many families to take out costly student loans are making it harder to get a college education than it was in previous generations. He equated beginning college with debt to â€œstarting a race with an anchor tied to your leg. â€ Just as society decided generations ago that it would fund public high school because the economy depended on it, Cuomo said, society should say the same about college today. While the governor hailed his statewide proposal as the first of its kind in the country, he is not the first politician to advance the idea. In 2015, Tennessee became the first state to make community college free for   seniors through a program championed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam. More than 20 of Californiaâ€™s community colleges now offer at least some funding and other support, often with help from private businesses and foundations, to local students. And where the Obama administration failed to move forward its plan to make community colleges across the country free â€”  in part because of Republican resistance to Washington intervening in what some conservatives view as a state issue â€”  there appears to be at least some bipartisan support for the idea of free college. Democrats have long framed the matter of free college as a way of giving all students equal access to educational opportunities no matter their backgrounds, while Republicans have argued that free college benefits local economies. Cuomo touched on that argument when he said he hoped the New York proposal would be â€œa   call to this nationâ€ if the United States wants to be competitive globally. In recent years, the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of students who complete degrees, and there are sizable gaps in college completion between white students and students of color, who make up a growing portion of the nationâ€™s young people. Less than 40 percent of students in New Yorkâ€™s   public universities and less than 10 percent of those at   public schools earned their degrees on time in 2013, according to the governorâ€™s office, and average   debt in the state had risen to more than $29, 000 by 2015.   tuition in New York currently ranges from around $4, 300 to $6, 500 a year. There is no guarantee, though, that Cuomo will be able to convince state lawmakers to move his plan forward, and not all students would be covered. The governorâ€™s office says the plan will cost about $163 million a year once itâ€™s fully phased in, which Cuomo would like to see happen by the fall of 2019. Making   college a reality ahead of a potential 2020 presidential run would be a political boon in a Democratic primary. According to the governorâ€™s office, the program would be funded through the stateâ€™s   program â€”  which provides close to $1 billion in grants to students â€”  federal grants, and other state funds. But whether state lawmakers, who have resisted earlier   plans, are willing to endorse the idea remains to be seen. And while Cuomo has supported state Dream Act proposals, which would open up such funding to undocumented students who graduate from high schools in New York, they are currently barred from receiving these grants, meaning undocumented students likely would not be covered by the   proposal. Itâ€™s also worth noting that university fees and    costs often present as much of a barrier as tuition does to college completion, with students of color,   students, and   college students less likely to earn degrees than their peers. But speaking briefly after Cuomo, Sanders, who grew up in New York, said he hoped the announcement would serve as a message to the stateâ€™s children that, if they work hard, they will be able to get a college education regardless of how much their families earn. â€œThat is a message that is going to provide hope and optimism to   families all across the state,â€ he said. If New York makes the proposal a reality, he predicted, other states will implement similar plans."
73287,"In 2007, only after historian Alexandra Minna Stern had spent years researching eugenics in the American west, culminating in a published book, did she find the motherlode. During the height of the eugenics movement, California sterilized 20, 000 patients deemed   or insane. Stern, who is a professor at the University of Michigan, wrote about the sterilization program in her book, but she had only a patchwork of records to work with. One day in 2007, a secretary pointed her toward a neglected filing cabinet at the state department of mental healthâ€™s office in Sacramento. Inside were 19 reels of coiled microfilm, containing sterilization recommendation forms with the names, ages, family histories, and diagnoses of nearly 20, 000 patients. These forgotten records covered patients recommended for sterilization at California state hospitals from 1919 to 1952. â€œThe microfilm was in very good shape,â€ says Stern. â€œI donâ€™t think anyone had looked at it since the 70s. â€ Recognizing the value of such a complete record, Stern had the microfilm duplicated. (Good thing because the original microfilm was later lost when the department reorganized following Californiaâ€™s budget cuts.) From there, the project morphed into something resembling contemporary data science more than traditional historical research. Stern hired a team of students to turn microfilm into a searchable database of health records â€”  powered by   clinical trial software. And along the way, the team encountered the promises and pitfalls of big data as applied to history. Recently, Stern   a paper estimating that as many as 831 of the patients sterilized are still alive. The paper, she hopes, will spark conversations about compensating those forcibly sterilized, like North Carolina and Virginia have done. Until now, such a conversation had not happened in California. Because to compensate people, you have to first know who they are. * * * California became the third state to pass a sterilization law in 1909. The law allowed superintendents at state psychiatric institutions to sterilize patients to improve their â€œphysical, mental, or moral condition. â€ The wording was vague, and it could be applied to patients considered mentally ill, handicapped, sexually deviant, criminal â€”  anyone considered a misfit, really. Sterilization would prevent these undesirable people from having children. As a kid growing up in California, Stern recalls these state institutions being evoked in schoolyard taunts â€”  like â€œOh youâ€™re weird, youâ€™ll end up in Napa,â€ referring to Napa State Hospital. The institutions performed vasectomies on men and salpingectomies, or the removal of Fallopian tubes in women. The 20, 000 people sterilized in California account for   of all such sterilizations in the U. S. Here are some of their stories, as previously written by Stern: In 1943, a      boy we will call Roberto was committed to the Sonoma State Home, an institution for the â€œfeeblemindedâ€ in Northern California. Robertoâ€™s journey to Sonoma began the previous year when he was picked up by the Santa Barbara Police for a string of infractions that included intoxication, a knife fight, and involvement with a â€œlocal gang of marauding Mexicans. â€ Citing his record of delinquency and â€œborderlineâ€ IQ score of 75, the officials at Sonoma recommended that Roberto be sterilized. Robertoâ€™s father adamantly, and unsuccessfully, opposed his sonâ€™s sterilization, and went so far as to secure a priest to protest the operation. Or the story of a young   woman: Silvia, a   mother of a toddler, was 20 years old when she was placed in Pacific Colony in 1950. She was assessed with an â€œimbecileâ€ IQ of 35 and reportedly had been raised in a violent home. Silviaâ€™s mother ostensibly could not control her daughter and approved her sterilization. Or that of a young, possibly gay, man: Fifteen years earlier, Timothy, a white   old placed in Stockton because of   encounters since boyhood and a psychiatric diagnosis of â€œdementia praecox, hebephrenic type,â€ consented to his own reproductive surgery, perhaps because he knew that it was a potential ticket out of the facility or because he felt it would help him control his pathologized sexual desires. These are individual stories, but Stern wanted to construct the database to find larger patterns. And of the foremost questions she wanted to ask was whether Hispanic patients were treated any differently in these institutions. The first step, just building a database, was no trivial task. The 20, 000 records each contained 212 individual variables. â€œImagine you put all that in Excel spreadsheet. Itâ€™s going to be a mind boggling mess,â€ says Stern. Since they were working with health records, they also needed to be in compliance with HIPAA. Sternâ€™s then graduate student Natalie Lira, now a professor of   studies at the University of Illinois   headed up that effort. She ended up collaborating with   from University of Michiganâ€™s School of Public Health to use Redcap, a data capture tool typical in clinical trials. Over three years, a team of undergraduate and graduate students entered the data off of the microfilm into a searchable database. Asking the question of who is Hispanic turned out to be complicated too. The forms did not have a line for ethnicity instead, they asked for â€œnativity,â€ where someone was originally born. A man of Mexican descent could be born in California, so nativity would not correlate with what we currently think of as Hispanic. When Nicole Novak, an epidemiologist who also worked on the project, went to look for census data on Hispanics living in California, she encountered more confusion. Mexicans, for example, where considered their own race in 1930, white in 1940 and after, though states in the Southwest had their own category for â€œwhite person of Spanish surname. â€ Looking at historic records, says Novak, â€œhas shed a lot of light on how constructed a lot of categories we use in public health are. â€ The team ended up using Spanish surnames as a proxy for Hispanic ethnicity, despite the imperfect correlation. (Filipinos, for example, also have Spanish surnames.) Eventually, they found that patients with Spanish surnames were indeed     times as likely to be sterilized than those without. The â€œnativityâ€ classification posed another question. Should the team use the original outdated terminology on the forms or attempt to update them to our modern language? â€œDo you use â€˜dementia praecox,â€™ which is roughly equivalent to schizophrenia today? Do you use the word â€˜Negro? â€™â€ says Stern. In the end, they ended up using the original terms. As a historian, Stern is very much aware of the pitfalls of using interpreting the past through a modern lens. â€œOne can be seduced by big data,â€ she says. â€œ You have to precede with caution. â€ To use this database is to interpret variables set a century ago. These issues are on Sternâ€™s mind now because the team is working to make the database available to other researchers. It also requires a delicate balance of privacy. Many of the records are now old enough that they are publicly available in Californiaâ€™s state archives in Sacramento. (The microfilm is the state archives is actually the duplicate set Stern made because, remember, the originals were lost.) But is that the same thing as putting them online for anyone to search? Especially if hundreds of these patients, as the recent paper suggests, are still alive? Sternâ€™s team, too, has had to balance their desires to learn more with the wishes of the people whose lives they are studying. The records are wealth of intimate information. And despite analyzing the data on a macro level â€”  831 survivors is a statistical estimate based on age â€”  they havenâ€™t gone looking for them individually. As a researcher, says Lira, â€œEthically, it feels wrong to look at someoneâ€™s medical records and try to reach out and contact them. â€ Stern says she has heard from family members of sterilized patients, who reached out after learning about her research. In one case, she also managed to track down the sister of a woman who had been sterilized and later filed a lawsuit. The sister called Stern back but said she didnâ€™t want to talk anymore because the past was too painful. Ideally, says Stern, the state of California would take on the task of finding these patients and compensating them. â€œItâ€™s more present in my mind now, that thereâ€™s a story for every single data point,â€ says Novak, who as an epidemiologists usually works with statistics. That filing cabinet in Sacramento held 20, 000 forgotten stories, now with 20, 000 names to go with them."
73435,"When Rex Tillerson goes before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on Wednesday for his confirmation hearings to become the next secretary of state, heâ€™ll likely face standard questions a range of international issues including the   peace process, Syria, and tensions in the South China Sea. But the committee has perhaps never assessed a pick like Tillerson, who spent his 10 years as the CEO of the energy multinational ExxonMobil focused on   shifts in the energy market and their impact on geopolitics. Rex Tillersonâ€™s Corporate Realpolitik, He has never served in public office. And his leadership of one of the most powerful corporations in the world, while it gave him State   experience negotiating in dozens of countries, could present substantial challenge for him if heâ€™s confirmed. His companyâ€™s relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin a shadowy  . S. oil venture based in the Bahamas, a tax haven as well as, allegedly, the governments of Iran, Syria, and Sudan, suggest a pragmatic businessman whose pursuit of profit, while legitimate,   leaves him open to difficult questions on his foreign ties. Most notable of these questions: Russia. For a time, Tillerson headed up ExxonMobilâ€™s Russian operations. He took a lead role on the companyâ€™s dealings in the countryâ€™s   oil and gas project, building a partnership with the   Russian oil firm Rosneft in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That deal â€”  conducted, at Tillersonâ€™s strenuous insistence, to the letter of Russian law â€”  paved the way for ExxonMobil to gain substantial equity in additional Russian oil fields, helping it replenish its reserves. Things were not always smooth: In 2003, ExxonMobil tried to acquire a stake in Mikhail Khodorkovskyâ€™s Yukos, the countryâ€™s largest private oil firm, just before the firm was nationalized and Khodorkovsky was arrested.  As Steve Coll writes in his book Private Empire, ExxonMobil during this time was helping broker stronger ties between the Bush administration and Vladimir Putin, since â€œthe Bush administration had decided that American foreign policy would embrace and promote the direct ownership of Russian oil by U. S. corporations. â€ In 2011, the company entered a $  joint venture to drill on the Arctic shelf and Black Sea, and another   deal in Siberia. For his efforts, Tillerson received the Russian Order of Friendship Prize from Putin in 2013. But these projects were halted in 2014, when the United States and other countries imposed sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and Crimea. One of the sanctioned individuals is Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft.  Tillerson is certain to field questions on whether he can remain objective where Russia is concerned, particularly on the issue of sanctions against the country in connection with its involvement in Ukraine or the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.  Tillerson has spoken frequently about   energy security, and his willingness to pursue deals in unstable countries. In one instance in 2011, ExxonMobil struck an exploration deal with the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq. Some of the blocks included in the deal edged into territory disputed by the Iraqi government. In striking the agreement, ExxonMobil, arguably, had bolstered the cause of Kurdish  . As the International Crisis Groupâ€™s Joost Hiltermann told me in December: â€œThe Kurds are taking unilateral steps to incorporate these areas, and theyâ€™re using companies such as Exxon, who are willing to be used, in order to further that goal. â€ Tillerson has made his financial disclosures and ethics agreement public, as Bloomberg noted, making him the only Trump cabinet pick to have done so thus far. He has worked out a complex arrangement with the State Department through which ExxonMobil will deposit his $180 million retirement payout into an independent trust to help avoid conflicts of interest. He has also pledged to divest from 156 entities in more than a dozen countries within 90 days of his confirmation. Unwinding his more than 2 million shares of ExxonMobil stock promises to be a far steeper challenge, due to the companyâ€™s strict liquidation policies. In addition, Tillerson, pursuant to federal law, must recuse himself from making decisions impacting ExxonMobil for one to two years, which could be difficult considering the companyâ€™s extensive global reach. In interviews, Tillerson has touted ExxonMobilâ€™s reputation for conducting business on firm legal footing. â€œ[I]tâ€™s up to me and the leadership and the corporation to insure that at all times though we are consistent with all of the laws, all of the rules, wherever we are operating anywhere in the world,â€ he told Charlie Rose in 2013.  But on Monday, USA Today reported that an ExxonMobil subsidiary conducted business with Iran, Syria, and Sudan in the early 2000s at a time when each country was under sanctions as a state sponsor of terrorism. According to filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, ExxonMobil conducted $53. 2 million in sales with Iran, $600, 000 to Sudan, and just over $1 million to Syria.  ExxonMobil told USA Today that its deals were legal because they were done through a   joint venture and did not involve U. S. employees. Tillerson, for his part, said in the 2013 Charlie Rose interview that ExxonMobil had no deals in Iran. In an interview with CNBC in March, he stressed that the company â€œnever had large investments in Iranâ€ due to the challenging terms of investing in the country. â€œWeâ€™ll wait and see if things open up for U. S. companies. We would certainly take a look because itâ€™s a huge   country. â€ After meeting with Tillerson on Monday, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, stressed in a statement the need for a secretary of state â€œwho will be an advocate for growing diplomacy as a tool in our national security toolkit, and who doesnâ€™t shy away from confronting countries like Russia over increased aggression,â€ and will protect human rights. â€œI remain unconvinced that Mr. Tillerson is a nominee that meets those standards, and I will continue to urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination,â€ he added. Murphyâ€™s Democratic counterpart Chris Coons, meanwhile, said several days ago that he was â€œencouragedâ€ by Tillersonâ€™s thoughts on sanctions, NATO, and defending U. S. allies in the Baltics, all issues that Trump has wavered on. On the Republican side, Arizona Senator John McCain told Politico that he still has â€œsome concernsâ€ and â€œmore questionsâ€ for Tillerson. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said, â€œMr. Tillersonâ€™s got to convince me, and I think other members of the body, that he sees Russia as a disruptive force, that he sees Putin as undermining democracy all over the world, not just in our backyard.   â€¦     He has to realize that the Russians did it when it came to the hacking and that new sanctions are justified.â€ The biggest question, perhaps, is how Tillersonâ€™s background as a corporate executive, beholden to shareholders, will inform his sense of the broader national interest when heâ€™s beholden to citizens. In one revealing exchange in his Charlie Rose interview, Tillerson argued that whatever promotes global energy security is in Americaâ€™s national interests. â€œWe do not represent the U. S. government as we travel around the world we never pretend to do that. And we never ask the U. S. government to do anything on our behalf. Weâ€™re perfectly willing and prefer to enter countries, construct our contracts and make our negotiations, ExxonMobil to the host country,â€ he said.  These sorts of dealings make Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, wary of the â€œbroader, revolving door question. â€ In Tillerson, he said, â€œyou have a guy whose spent his entire career in Exxon, has no qualifications for this job [of secretary of state] except his work at Exxon. And that just raises huge questions, probably unanswerable ones, about how he will cease to represent the views of Exxon in this job, or the oil industry more generally, instead of advancing the interest of the American people. â€ If Graham and McCainâ€™s recent moves were any indication, theyâ€™re prepared to hold Tillerson and the Trump administration accountable where Russia is concerned. Late on Tuesday, the senators announced a new, bipartisan sanctions bill seeking to further isolate Russia economically, in response to the hacking allegations. The sanctions would, notably, hit companies looking to invest in Russian energy."
73369,"Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former Iranian president who died Sunday at the age of 82, was viewed as a consummate political insider and reformer in a country where conservatives have held sway since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Although he was a longtime ally of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic republic, Rafsanjani came to prominence as speaker of Iranâ€™s parliament in the 1980s. He was appointed    of the countryâ€™s military in the last days of the   war and was seen as instrumental in accepting the United Nations Security Council resolution that ended the   conflict. Two events that occurred after Khomeiniâ€™s death in 1989 have shaped modern Iran: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, then a Rafsanjani ally, was named supreme leader. Rafsanjani was elected president the same year. These two men influenced Iranian politics â€”  sometimes working together, sometimes as bitter enemies â€”  over the next three decades. Khamenei sought to maintain Iran as an   bastion in the Middle East while Rafsanjani supported change. As president, Rafsanjani opened up the countryâ€™s moribund economy, encouraged family planning by promoting contraceptive use, and placed women in prominent positions â€”  all the while facing opposition from the countryâ€™s  . But he also amassed a great deal of personal wealth. He was believed to be one of the richest men in the country and was placed by Forbes on its list of â€œMillionaire Mullahs. â€ Under Rafsanjani, Iran was by no means a   democracy. Human rights were still suppressed and dissent crushed. As recently as 2015, Rafsanjani said Israel will be â€œwiped off the map. â€ He served two terms as president â€”  and was constitutionally forbidden from seeking a third term.      Rafsanjani remained active in politics after he left the presidency. In 2002, he was named head of the Expediency Council, the body that settles disputes between the Majlis, Iranâ€™s parliament, and the Guardian Council, the body that vets legislation and supervises elections. Three years later, he sought the presidency again, but lost to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the populist mayor of Tehran, whose policies Rafsanjani publicly criticized. In 2006, he was named head of the Assembly of Experts, which appoints Iranâ€™s supreme leader. It was in that position that he supported Mir Hossein Mousavi, the reformist leader who sought the presidency and ultimately lost to Ahmadinejad in the contentious 2009 election. That election caused a major rift between Rafsanjani and Khamenei, Iranâ€™s supreme leader. Ahmadinejad accused Mousavi of being backed by corrupt individuals, but he did not name Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani, in an open letter, appeared to accused the supreme leader of remaining silent in light of the accusations. Rafsanjani and his family fell out of political favor after that. An attempt to seek the presidency in 2013 was blocked by the Guardian Council, stunning Iranians. At the time of his death Sunday, Rafsanjani remained a member of the Assembly of Experts, but his influence on Iranian politics had waned."
73462,"President Obamaâ€™s farewell speech was an exercise in marking norms. Offering a clear message to his successor, he spoke about the importance of civil liberties and rejecting discrimination against Muslims. He argued that protecting the American â€œway of lifeâ€ means â€œ[guarding] against a weakening of the values that make us who we are,â€ highlighting his administrationâ€™s work â€œto put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. â€ He went on: â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™ve ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. â€ He used forms of the word â€œdemocracyâ€ 27 times. Surveillance, indefinite detention, counterterrorism, and torture have emerged as prominent issues during the Senate hearings about Donald Trumpâ€™s administration picks. It is not yet clear what Trumpâ€™s policies on these issues will be, although his comments on the campaign trail suggest he supports the use of torture, keeping Guantanamo Bay open, and surveilling mosques and certain American citizens, among other things. Why Trumpâ€™s    Plan Wonâ€™t Prevent Conflicts of Interest, But anything Trump does will be built on legal â€œinfrastructureâ€ created by the Obama administration, argues Jameel Jaffer, the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. It may be true that Obama worked to create a sound legal basis for his administrationâ€™s   and surveillance policies, Jaffer said. But in doing so, he also gave his policies, many of which were extensions of the Bush era, a sense of permanence and legitimacy. Now, Trump will inherit the â€œfirm legal footingâ€ Obama helped created. During his time at the ACLU, Jaffer led litigation against the Obama administration on a number of   and transparency issues, and he recently wrote a book on the legal memos that enabled the administrationâ€™s policy on drone strikes. Jaffer currently leads the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and is an executive editor for the blog Just Security. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Emma Green: Letâ€™s go through each of Obamaâ€™s claims. Hereâ€™s the first: His administration â€œput the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. â€ Thatâ€™s kind of hard to parse, but seems to be a reference to policies put in place during the Bush administration. Itâ€™s broad, but how well do you think this claim holds up? Jameel Jaffer: The administration has a mixed record. They deserve credit for the disavowal of torture, the shuttering of the CIAâ€™s black sites, and the commitment to close Guantanamo and the significant progress they made toward that goal. They deserve credit for the transparency decisions they made very early on in 2009 relating to the interrogation of prisoners. They also abandoned, or at least downplayed, arguments relating to the presidentâ€™s authority as commander in chief. The Bush administration argued that the president had the authority to ignore statutory law with respect to surveillance, interrogation, and torture. Their argument was that the president gets to decide what our   policies are, and if Congress has legislated in the area of national security, the president has the authority as commander in chief to ignore that legislation. That was an extremely dangerous argument, and one that the courts ultimately rejected. The Obama administration was right to abandon those arguments. But I do think itâ€™s important to recognize that in abandoning those constitutional arguments, the Obama administration ended up interpreting statutes very broadly. Obama didnâ€™t argue that the president had the authority to ignore the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. He interpreted it to give him all the authority that he wanted. It was the same as Section 215 of the Patriot Act: The administration interpreted that provision so broadly that they didnâ€™t have to rely on constitutional authority. They didnâ€™t have to make the argument that the president, as commander in chief, has the authority to collect everybodyâ€™s call records because they were interpreting the federal statute so broadly that it allowed whatever they wanted it to. Green: Hereâ€™s another claim: The Obama administration â€œended torture. â€ Does that stand, as a categorical statement? Jaffer: Heâ€™s right about that. This is an important thing that his administration did on the first day, which is to expressly disavow torture, withdraw the legal memos that were the basis of the torture program, close the CIAâ€™s black sites permanently. Those were important decisions and the administration deserves credit for them. The caveat, which is an important one, is that after having done all of those things on day one, the administration invoked the   privilege over and over to prevent those who had been the victims of these policies from having their day in court. People who sought accountability for their torture in CIA custody or in military custody were kicked out of court because the administration argued that those cases were too sensitive to litigate. Green: Another claim he made was that his administration worked to â€œreform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. â€ To what extent do you think that holds up? Jaffer: There were some changes made by Congress in the summer of 2015, which the administration supported. The changes were modest, and came about only because Snowden disclosed what he disclosed. But for those disclosures, none of those reforms would have taken place. The administration still characterizes Snowden as a criminal. Thereâ€™s an irony in the Obama administration trying to take credit for these positive changes in the law while also trying to prosecute the person who is most responsible for bringing these changes about. Green: The Obama administrationâ€™s aggressive prosecution of whistleblowers stands in contrast to some of the claims he made in his speech about protecting civil liberties. How does that policy connect to some of these issues? Jaffer: This administration came in saying this would be the most transparent administration in the history of the United States. Over time, they became more closed and less forthcoming. They withheld many of the most crucial documents related to   policy, including the drone memos, until courts ordered them to release them, and information about government surveillance, until Snowden disclosed that information. And they brought more prosecutions against government whistleblowers than all previous administrations combined. Green: How does the administrationâ€™s drone policy fit into Obamaâ€™s legacy on national security and transparency? Jaffer: The phrase Obama used was putting â€œthe fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. â€ The other way to look at it is that this administration has normalized and entrenched many of the policies of the last administration. It would have been possible, eight years ago, to think of the Bush administrationâ€™s policies as aberrational â€”  to see them as a reaction, and an overreaction, to the events of  . Itâ€™s no longer possible to see these policies that way because the Obama administration has endorsed so many of them. With respect to the drone campaign, thatâ€™s especially true: The Obama administration built a bureaucratic infrastructure to support this practice of targeted killing. It expanded the program dramatically. It now carries out, routinely, strikes in seven different countries most of those countries are not conventional battlefields. I donâ€™t think President Bush would have been able to expand the drone campaign in the way that Obama eventually did. Now weâ€™ve invested all this power in the presidency, and all that power will be available to President Trump and whoever comes after President Trump. Green: Whatâ€™s the outlook for some of these issues, in your view, with the incoming administration? Jaffer: Given the some of the statements of candidate Trump during the campaign, and given the track records of some of the people who are advising him at the highest levels, I think there are a lot of reasons to worry about how the new administration will use the powers that President Obama created or put on a relatively sound legal footing: the power to detain, the power to surveil, the power to kill. The   has already made clear that he wants to use some of these powers even more aggressively: He wants to step up surveillance inside the United States, especially of Muslims. He wants to expand the war on terror. He has proposed resurrecting the torture policies. [In November, Trump told The New York Times that he has changed his view on this issue after consulting with his   for Secretary of Defense, the retired U. S. Marine Corps General James Mattis.] Itâ€™s difficult to know which of these promises will translate into actual policy, but thereâ€™s certainly reason to worry that these powers will be used even more aggressively and in an even less discriminating way than theyâ€™ve been used until now."

73303,"At a recent teaching conference in Richmond, Virginia, a session on â€œdesign thinkingâ€ in education drew a capacity crowd. Two   teachers demonstrated how they had used the concept to plan and execute an   project in which students were asked to develop a hypothetical city or town given factors such as population, geography, the environment, and financial resources. The teachers in the audience were enchanted by the details of the project and if the photographs in the presentation were any indication, the students who participated in the lesson enjoyed it, too. The presenting teachers were bubbling over with enthusiasm for what they saw as the potential inherent in teaching design thinking. Many of the teachers in attendance were flummoxed, however. As we filed out of the room and headed toward our next sessions, I overheard one woman remark to another that while the   project looked like something sheâ€™d like to try in her own classroom, â€œI think I missed something. I still donâ€™t understand what design thinking is. Do you?â€ The other teacher shook her head and said, â€œI think itâ€™s a curriculum, but Iâ€™m not really sure. â€ The Common   Tool Thatâ€™s Banned in College, Confusion around the precise definition of design thinking is understandable, said Neil Stevenson, the executive portfolio director at IDEO Chicago, one of the   purveyors of design thinking. â€œDesign thinking isnâ€™t one thing,â€ he told me in a phone interview, â€œbut a bundle of mindsets and philosophies all wrapped up in one term, which obviously has the potential to lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. â€ While Stevenson spent plenty of time talking around a definition â€”  explaining mindsets, the nature of creativity, and the evolution of design â€”  even convincing him to offer a brief definition proved difficult. Finally, Stevenson outlined what he sees as the foundational aspects of design thinking as it relates to educators: First, he emphasized, design thinking starts with empathy. When designing anything meant to be used by another person â€”  whether thatâ€™s a lesson, curriculum, classroom layout, or an imaginary city â€”  the designer must understand what that person (an â€œâ€ in design lingo) needs. In the case of the   project, for example, the students canâ€™t just design a pretty building they must think about the needs of the people who will live there, as well as the available resources, the budget, and the impact that building will have on the surrounding landscape. â€œThe   philosophy requires the designer to put his or her ego to the side and seek to meet the unmet needs, both rational and emotional, of the user,â€ Stevenson explained. Once the student designers have gathered all their research together, they must organize and make sense of it all. Again, in the case of the   project, after the students have gathered interviews and research about the needs of their cityâ€™s future residents, students must figure out what to do with all that information. If, for example, the future residentsâ€™ top priorities include affordability and opulence, the student designer is going to have to find a way to integrate the residentsâ€™ conflicting needs. Finally, design thinking requires designers to generate ideas â€”  lots of ideas â€”  and prototype them. In order for this part of the process to work, students and teachers must be comfortable with failure. For many students, particularly those who want to look smart, this phase can be frustrating. â€œPeople tend to come up with an idea early on, and know that this idea is it, the perfect idea, and get emotionally invested in that one thing. Then, when their perfect idea fails, they fall apart,â€ Stevenson said. Design thinking forces students to keep their minds open, to try out lots of ideas early in the process before they let their egos or emotions get too invested in just one. There will be a time to put spitballing aside, of course. Once ideas have been prototyped and tested, students begin to work toward one effective, final solution â€”  an end product that can be assessed, presented, displayed, or put to work in their classroom or community. The beauty of the design process, proponents say, is that the value of the experience does not lie solely in the end product. Learning happens throughout the process, from the early research phase to the final presentation. This allows students and teachers to focus on whatâ€™s most important in learning: the process, rather than the product. One scene from the film Apollo 13 provides a great illustration of the   process. After Apollo 13 is crippled by an explosion, the astronauts are stranded in the lunar module. The air filters in the lunar module are failing, so the engineers at NASA must find a way to make a square filter fit into a round hole using only the materials available to the astronauts. The engineers find a solution through design thinking: by understanding the needs and resources of the astronauts, organizing the resources available on the lunar module, then working together to develop and prototype many ideas. The ultimate solution may not have been pretty, but it was creative and it was effective. Their design saved the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts. This sort of    formulaic approach to creative   was revolutionary and counterintuitive when it was first developed in reaction to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. When Russia leapfrogged ahead of the rest of the world in the space race, the U. S. needed to respond with a rapid and radical acceleration in technological innovation. The process of design thinking emerged as an effort to encourage all scientists â€”  even the least creative, most inflexible thinkers â€”  to be novel, brave, and innovative in their  . Historically, creativity has been portrayed as a mysterious, elusive force â€”  a gift from the gods or the muses. Creativity canâ€™t be summoned, the thinking goes, let alone taught to the mentally inflexible, unimaginative,   masses. Design thinking upends that perception and assumes that anyone can be a creative  . At its best, design thinking incorporates   teaching techniques such as   inquiry and collaborative   and dovetails nicely with   learning curricula that emphasize interpersonal skills such as collaboration and empathy. And the end result of a   project is often a tangible product, such as a model city, a robot, or a better mousetrap.  Itâ€™s no surprise, then, that many educators are eager to adopt design thinking as a way to plan their own teaching and as a strategy for helping their students learn through solving   problems. The popularity of design thinking, however, might be precisely whatâ€™s contributing to the confusion I witnessed in Virginia, says Stevenson: Itâ€™s been extremely gratifying for all of us practicing design to see the ideas taken on by so many people. Thereâ€™s a downside, though, which is that when something becomes popular, now suddenly everyone wants to learn it and lots and lots of people will spring up and teach it. For the sake of communication, we tend to define design thinking as A followed by B followed by C, but in doing this, we are guilty of oversimplifying. As teachers seek to learn more about design thinking and its application in their classrooms, conference sessions and certificate programs have emerged to accommodate demand. Stanfordâ€™s   and IDEO offer two popular courses, but there are many flavors, colors, and brands of design thinking for educators to choose from. In other words, the lack of a clear definition makes explaining, evaluating, and studying design thinking a challenge. And some teachers at that conference in Virginia â€”  myself included â€”  were skeptical, and attended the   session to better understand whether the concept is actually an effective learning strategy or simply another education trend gone viral despite scant objective data regarding its effectiveness for learning. When executed with a clear understanding of its purpose as a method for fostering empathy, creativity, and innovation, design thinking can be a powerful tool for learning and change. If it is hastily and inexpertly implemented by educators with a weak or incomplete understanding of its principles, however, it is likely to be a waste of energy and precious classroom time. Design thinking, like Carol Dweckâ€™s work on fixed and growth mindsets and Angela Duckworthâ€™s research on grit, are best understood in context, as a complex and nuanced approach to learning rather than a checklist of executable tasks. Dweck was so alarmed by the rampant oversimplification of fixed and growth mindsets that she wrote an article for Edutopia to clear up common misconceptions about her work. Just as Dweckâ€™s work canâ€™t be conveyed adequately in a Life Hack infographic, and Duckworthâ€™s research is apt to be misunderstood when reduced to a listicle, design thinking seems likely to fail as an educational tool when communicated in terms of â€œFive Simple Steps. â€ Mindsets, grit, and design thinking are all victims of their own massive popularity, and in the rush to incorporate these concepts into existing lesson plans, have sometimes been reduced to checklist items on teachersâ€™ overcrowded   lists. When treated as a classroom culture, however, rather than an action, design thinking (as well as mindset and grit) may revolutionize the way teachers and students think about failure, creative   and teamwork. Ultimately, design thinking is not a curriculum, advocates like Stevenson say, but a process for   a strategy to elicit creativity rooted in empathy and comfort with failure. Teachers can use design thinking to create a classroom layout that conforms to the needs of their students, they say, or to plan lessons that will work best for the students in a given school or classroom. Entire school districts are embracing design thinking to create spaces and curricula around the intellectual and emotional needs of their students. Teachers are also helping students use design thinking to apply what theyâ€™ve learned to   problems, such as the   project described by those   teachers in Virginia. While there is not a lot of data to support any particular brand of design thinking as an effective teaching or learning strategy, the key elements of design thinking will be familiar to any teacher   in the basics of effective teaching: start with empathy, move ego to the side, and support students in the process of failing often and early on their way to learning."
73334,"Donald Trump is practically alone in mainstream American politics in his consistent praise of Vladimir Putin and insistence that the United States would benefit from warmer relations with Russia. But that inclination to view Putin more as ally than adversary places Trump squarely in line with the racially infused,   movements gaining ground in both America and Europe. And that means the   friction over Russia between Trump and more traditional   thinkers like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina points toward a much larger debate over the priorities that should drive American foreign policy. The Key to Putinâ€™s Cyber Power, Across the political spectrum, mainstream   thinkers in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a threat largely because he is pushing to expand Russian influence across eastern Europe and the Middle East in ways that could destabilize the U. S.  system of alliances and global rules that has defined the international order since World War II. That concern has spiked amid a succession of provocative actions from Putin, ranging from his 2014 incursion into Ukraine and brutal military campaign against   rebels in Syria, to the U. S. intelligence communityâ€™s conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party email accounts to influence the 2016 American presidential election. (Trump, due to receive an intelligence briefing about those conclusions on Friday, has steadfastly resisted and belittled that conclusion.) But the   nationalists in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a potential ally because they are focused on a sharply contrasting set of international priorities: resisting Islamic radicalization, unwinding global economic integration, and fighting the secularization of Western societies. Top Trump advisers like incoming White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have expressed strikingly similar views. In that way, the clashing perspectives on Putin reflect not only differences on how to relate specifically to Russia, but on what goals should guide American foreign policy in the 21st century, and what allies are necessary to advance those aims. On both sides of the Atlantic, the push to reset with Putin reflects a desire to elevate a different set of   concerns while downplaying, or even abandoning, the alliances that have bound European nations more tightly to each other, and to the United States, for decades. One critical variable of the Trump presidency may be how far this radical shift in perspective advances in a Republican Party where most elected officials and   analysts still believe global stability depends on an   network of rules and alliances, and still view Putin as an escalating threat to that order. Though the   embrace of Putin common in Europe remains confined to the GOPâ€™s margins, it appears to be establishing a beachhead under Trump, noted Richard Fontaine, president of the centrist Center for a New American Security, and the former top   aide to McCain. â€œItâ€™s already going further than I expected it to go,â€ Fontaine said in an interview. â€œThe fact that     Republicans are going out and suggesting we donâ€™t know who hacked what [in the 2016 campaign] and the sanctions may be an overreaction is not a terribly encouraging sign. â€ The major conservative nationalist and populist movements in Europe, including Franceâ€™s National Front, Britainâ€™s U. K. Independence Party, Germanyâ€™s Alternative for Germany, the Netherlandsâ€™s Party for Freedom, Austriaâ€™s Freedom Party, and Hungaryâ€™s Jobbik, donâ€™t completely overlap in their views of Putin. Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, for instance, has been cooler toward Putin than the National Frontâ€™s Marine Le Pen, who borrowed from a Russian bank to help fund the partyâ€™s 2014 electoral campaign, or the Freedom Party, which recently signed a â€œcooperation agreementâ€ with Putinâ€™s United Russia party. But the European populist parties share a common set of priorities focused on restricting immigration, unwinding global economic and political integration (by renouncing the European Union, and, for some of these parties, NATO as well) taking tougher steps to fight Islamic radicalism, and, in most cases, opposing cultural liberalism and secularization at home. On all those fronts, they view Putin not as a threat, but as an ally. â€œItâ€™s certainly not that they follow him the way Communist parties used to follow the Soviet Union. Thatâ€™s a misrepresentation,â€ said Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia associate professor of international affairs who studies these movements. â€œBut   â€¦     they do like his strength, what they perceive as defense for strong traditional values, nationalism, and opposition to Islam. â€ On each of those concerns, Putin has positioned himself as a bulwark of conservative values. First in Chechnya and more recently in Syria, he can claim to have taken the fight to Islamic extremists, perhaps more aggressively than any Western nation since America overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan (of course, Russiaâ€™s Syria campaign has focused far less on combating the Islamic State than on obliterating opponents of President Bashar  â€™s regime). Conservative populists like Le Pen have hailed Putinâ€™s hostility toward global institutions as a model for prioritizing nationalist independence over multilateral cooperation and integration. â€œThe model that is defended by Vladimir Putin is radically different to that of Mr. Obama,â€ Le Pen told a British television interviewer last November. â€œAs for me, the model that is defended by Vladimir Putin, which is one of reasoned protectionism, looking after the interests of his own country, defending his identity, is one that I like, as long as I can defend this model in my own country. â€ Particularly since his return to the Russian presidency in 2012, Putin has portrayed himself as a defender of traditional social values, especially in opposition to gay rights, and as a religiously devout alternative to Western countries that he has said â€œare denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious, and even sexual. â€ While the idea of Putin lecturing the world on â€œmoral principlesâ€ grates on mainstream ears, that stance has also drawn praise, not only from conservative populists in Europe, but also   American activists, like columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, whose 1996 bid for the GOP presidential nomination presaged many of Trumpâ€™s insular themes. Against these shared priorities, the European populist parties almost universally downplay Putinâ€™s destabilizing moves, including those in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea, as, at most, a   concern. Nigel Farage, a founder of the U. K. Independence Party and the European populist leader personally closest to Trump, has said that while Putinâ€™s incursion in Ukraine was not justified, it was an understandable response to Western overreach. â€œThe Ukrainian crisis actually was sparked by the European Union saying they wanted to extend their borders to take in the Ukraine, which Putin took as being a direct threat,â€ Farage told Fox News last summer. â€œNow, my view on Putin and the Russians is, donâ€™t poke the Russian bear with a stick. If you do, youâ€™re bound to get a response. â€ Farageâ€™s take is common among Europeâ€™s conservative populists. â€œThey donâ€™t think that Russia wants to reinstate a Soviet Union. They consider Russia pretty much defending itself against globalism, and they would like to have the EU or NATO out of central and eastern Europe,â€ Mudde said. â€œBut they donâ€™t assume that Russia then moves back in. Russia is of no concern to them. They donâ€™t believe Russia has ambitions to threaten western Europe. â€ To a striking extent, top Trump advisers Flynn and especially Bannon have expressed similar views in recent years. In an extensive 2014 speech at the Vatican unearthed by Buzzfeed, Bannon echoed common arguments from the European nationalist parties to explain why people he called â€œtraditionalistsâ€ were drawn to Putin. Bannon portrayed Putin as championing both nationalism and conservative cultural values. â€œOne of the reasons [Putin is attractive to â€˜traditionalistsâ€™] is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and heâ€™s trying to do it in a form of nationalism â€”  and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism for their country,â€ Bannon said. â€œThey donâ€™t believe in this kind of   Union or they donâ€™t believe in the centralized government in the United States. â€ Later, Bannon added: â€œPutinâ€™s been quite an interesting character. Heâ€™s also very, very, very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where heâ€™s playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional values. â€ To a greater extent than the European populists, Bannon was careful to also criticize the Russian leader, saying â€œPutin and his cronies [are] a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. â€ But like Europeâ€™s   populists, Bannon immediately argued that the potential threat Putin posed ranked below more pressing concerns, like allying with the Russian leader against Islamic terrorism. â€œI really believe that in this current environment, where youâ€™re facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation â€”   Iâ€™m not saying we can put it on a back burner â€”  but I think we have to deal with first things first. â€ Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, similarly suggested sublimating American concerns about Russian behavior to the struggle against Islamic terror during his controversial visit to Moscow in December 2015. â€œI am speaking as [a] private citizen, but the U. S. canâ€™t sit there and go: â€˜Russia, youâ€™re badâ€™ Russia canâ€™t sit there and be â€˜U. S. youâ€™re bad! â€™â€ Flynn said in an interview on RT, Russiaâ€™s     television network. â€œI think that we have to step back and we have to say: â€˜Okay, what are the common interests, and what are the common goals that we want to achieveâ€™ â€”  and   â€¦     I believe, the number one goal is to eliminate this cancerous idea that exists inside the Islamic religion. â€ Expanding the argument, Flynn suggested that the new threat of global terror required a fundamental shift in priorities that would position the United States and Russia less as competitors than as collaborators in a common fight. â€œ[W]e have to begin to understand that this is not an   world, folks, [that itâ€™s] actually more of a   world, and we have to decide â€”  U. S. Europe, Russia and other, other countries, countries in South America, maybe, and even China and India, how do we want the world to be over the course of the next 10 years, 25 years, 50 years?â€ Flynn added. â€œ[I] donâ€™t believe for a second that weâ€™re going to defeat the Islamic State in two years. This has been described as a   War. â€ How many of these views Trump personally shares is unclear. He has said strikingly little about why he believes better relations with Putin would advantage the United States, other than to broadly suggest the two nations could work together more effectively against ISIS. Many analysts see Trumpâ€™s attraction to Putin as mostly a personal connection driven both by Trumpâ€™s admiration for his   style, and Putinâ€™s careful flattery of the  . But Fontaine, the former McCain aide and CNAS president, said a tilt toward Putin would be compatible with two larger   tendencies Trump has hinted at. One is an inclination to view â€œChina as the bigger threatâ€ to the United States both because of its aggressive posture in Asia and because it represents a much more formidable economic competitor than Russia. Second, Fontaine noted, Trump at various points has suggested â€”  particularly in his comments about Asia â€”  that he is more comfortable trying to maintain global stability through regional â€œspheres of influenceâ€ led by locally dominant powers than through â€œone unified world order in which American power is the ultimate foundation. â€ Through that lens, Fontaine continued, Russiaâ€™s attempts to expand its reach in eastern Europe â€œmay not be as concerning to you than if you are concerned that it is undermining the   system of the world. â€ So far, Fontaine said, this more benign assessment of Putin has very little support among elected officials in either party. â€œAlmost everybody thinks if we can find some way to work with Russia on discrete issues, [then] sure [letâ€™s pursue those opportunities],â€ he said. â€œBut that there is no overarching deal, or friendly bond between the U. S. and this Russia that can be had either without compromising fundamental interests or principles, or seeing the agreement go up in smoke when Russia violates it. â€ McCain offered the rallying cry for that competing view in his bristling opening statement at Thursdayâ€™s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Russian hacking and other cyber threats. â€œIt should not surprise us that Vladimir Putin would think he could launch increasingly severe cyberattacks against our nation,â€ McCain insisted, â€œwhen he has paid little price for invading Ukraine, annexing Crimea, subverting democratic values and institutions across Europe, and of course, helping Bashar [ ]Assad slaughter civilians in Syria for more than a year with impunity. â€ And yet both in America and in Europe, electoral momentum has been growing for the   and populist movements arguing for a fundamental reassessment of global alliances that would include a reset of relations with Russia. The depth of Putinâ€™s commitments to these movements is likely shallow: As Mudde noted, Russia has touted   parties in Europe as well when that suits its interests. But Putin has also clearly demonstrated that he views the rise of conservative nationalism as an ally of convenience in a goal that suddenly seems more obtainable than at any time in decades: loosening the Western alliance from both its American and European moorings. â€œI donâ€™t think we should underestimate the degree to which the undermining of the fabric of Western society is a fundamental aim of what Putin is all about,â€ said Ivo Daalder, President Obamaâ€™s former permanent representative to NATO and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. â€œWe are in a very different time period that has far more to do with the 1920s and 1930s than it does with 2010. We are at a tipping point where the success of these [populist] movements raises fundamental question about the [viability of the] international order we are living in. â€ Atlantic assistant editor Leah Askarinam contributed."

Tragedy in Turkey: Authorities are still searching for the attacker who killed 39 people and wounded at least 70 in a shooting at an Istanbul nightclub early on New Yearâ€™s Day. Yesterday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, describing the gunman as a â€œheroic soldierâ€ acting on the orders of the Islamic Stateâ€™s highest leader. Though ISIS has been suspected of terror attacks in Turkey before, it hasnâ€™t claimed one outright until now, while the Turkish government has had an inconsistent stance toward the terrorist group. For these reasons, writes Graeme Wood, the Istanbul attack is pivotal: It adds Turkey to the list of countries against which ISIS is waging outright war. Confusion in Congress: Last night, House Republicans voted suddenly and secretly to deeply undermine the Office of Congressional Ethics. Today, amid outrage â€”  and hours after   Donald Trump tweeted a lukewarm critique of the move â€”  the Republicans called an emergency meeting to reverse their decision. The   marks an embarrassing moment for the legislators, but it also foreshadows an era of ambitious and aggressive policymaking from the GOP majority â€”  as well as the resistance from Democrats to go with it. Transition Trouble: With less than three weeks to go before Trump takes office, his transition team is lagging behind schedule to fill positions in the new administration, largely because many of the nominees havenâ€™t been fully vetted yet. On top of late starts to the   process, the team faces an extra hurdle in the fact that Trump has chosen a number of wealthy business executives, whose complex financial portfolios make their potential conflicts of interest particularly hard to straighten out. Meanwhile, Trump has his own conflicts of interest to worry about (you can follow our running list of them here). He has insisted that his business interests wonâ€™t sway him â€”  but as numerous studies on the financial biases of doctors have shown, thatâ€™s a resolution much easier made than carried out. Michael Lewis, author of a new book on the founders of behavioral economics, discusses how their work reaches far beyond academia â€”  and how it helps to explain the 2016 election. Jacob Saxton, creator of a Twitter account that chronicles Chinaâ€™s Cultural Revolution in real time, shares what itâ€™s like to relive a historic period of chaos and change. R. R. Reno, editor of the conservative religious magazine First Things, discusses Americaâ€™s national identity and why heâ€™s â€œguardedly optimisticâ€ about Trump. Megan Garber on the new reality TV: Television has long had a fraught relationship with the â€œregularâ€ person. Many of its shows, from Leave It to Beaver on down, have relied on the power of aspiration â€”  the ideal family, the ideal group of friends, impossibly beautiful people inhabiting impossibly beautiful places â€”  to amplify the appeal of the â€œnormalâ€ worlds theyâ€™ve served up to their viewers. . .. Many of the new shows of 2016, though, took that approach â€”  the everyday, gilded with the shiny stuff of fantasy â€”  and stripped it of its varnish. The concerns that were so often, in the past, relegated to the plot lines of individual episodes (a   here, an illness there) were put   as series overtly emphasized what used to be matters of taboo: money, infidelity, weight, special needs. In a year in which so many things beyond politics themselves were political, many TV shows continued a trend that had been brewing with the rise of social media and Peak TV. Perhaps realizing televisionâ€™s power to change the way people see the world, show creators rejected easy aspiration and blithe escapism â€”  they instead got insistently, and compellingly, real.

73223,"On August 15th, with little fanfare, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took steps to improve its ability to deal with infectious outbreaks. The agency proposed a new rule that would expand its powers to screen, test, and quarantine people traveling into or within the United States, in the event of a crisis like the historic Ebola outbreak of 2014. On the face of it, this sounds like a good thing. The threat of infectious diseases is omnipresent and growing. Familiar threats like flu, Ebola, or measles continually rear their heads, often in new guises, while completely new dangers like MERS or SARS can take the world by surprise. When that happens, the CDC must act quickly and decisively â€”  and its new powers will purportedly help it to do so. But some epidemiologists, lawyers, and health organizations say that the rule, in its current form poses a serious threat to civil liberties, allowing authorities to detain and examine people with little heed to due process and informed consent.   â€œTheyâ€™re giving themselves the benefit of the doubt,â€ says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the UPMC Center for Health Security and a   of a recent paper criticizing the proposed rule. â€œI donâ€™t worry about the CDC. I worry about people above them making them do things they donâ€™t want to do because theyâ€™ve given themselves these broad powers. Those powers will make their jobs easier, until they donâ€™t. â€ The CDC tried this play in 2005, proposing a rule that would have expanded their quarantine powers and required airlines to maintain a traveler database. But after a wave of critical comments, including from the travel industry, they shelved the rule. Its new incarnation is similar, but perhaps even broader in scope. It covers â€œ  emergencies,â€ which are defined as any â€œcommunicable disease eventâ€ that the Director thinks could spread or â€œis highly likely to cause death or serious illness if not properly controlled. â€ (The Director can be changed by the President at any time without Senate confirmation.) During such events, the CDC could screen people at airports and other transport hubs, apprehend those they suspect of being ill for three days, and potentially quarantine or isolate them pending a medical review. It is already authorized to detain people suspected of carrying diseases like plague, Ebola, and (somewhat improbably) smallpox. But the new rule does away with a formal list. It extends the same powers to any â€œquarantinable communicable disease,â€ and uses wider range of symptoms (from a list that federal agents can update as the need arises) for defining â€œillâ€ people. There are good reasons behind these semantic expansions. The current system was enshrined in 1944 and needs an update in the face of the diseases that have arisen since. For example, the existing list of warning symptoms doesnâ€™t cover many important signs of known diseases like Ebola and MERS. Meanwhile, new and unknown illnesses are emerging all the time. â€œThe CDC trying to equip itself with sufficient flexibility to respond to diseases weâ€™ve never heard of, in a way where it doesnâ€™t have to revisit these rules every few years,â€ says James Hodge Jr, a professor of   law and ethics at Arizona State University. â€œIâ€™m supportive of that. â€ But Hodge, Nuzzo, and others feel that the CDC risks sacrificing personal liberty at the altar of flexibility and expediency. â€œThe rule allows the CDC to move on somebody based on some belief that they might pose some amorphous risk to others,â€ says Hodge. â€œThatâ€™s not a standard that survives constitutional scrutiny. â€ For a start, the rule is sparse when it comes to due process. It allows the CDC to detain travelers indefinitely before deciding whether to quarantine them, saying only that the agency â€œdoesnâ€™t expectâ€ such apprehensions to last for more than 72 hours. It doesnâ€™t make provisions for legal counsel if people canâ€™t afford a lawyer themselves. And it puts any reviews of the agencyâ€™s decisions under the auspices of its own employees, rather than a neutral third party. Using the rule, â€œa future administration could hold travelers in government custody for days or weeks without providing an explanation or an opportunity for the individuals to challenge their detentions,â€ write Emma Roth and Kyle Edwards from Yale Law School. The rule also gives the CDC ultimate authority to carry out medical tests and treatments, stating that â€œthe individualâ€™s consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to the exercise of any authority. â€ Thatâ€™s medically unethical, says Hodge, since informed consent has been a bedrock of medicine for decades. â€œIf you donâ€™t get it, you could have additional quarantine, but you donâ€™t get to force informed consent on people. â€ Perhaps the most striking thing about these criticisms is how easy it would be for the CDC to have its cake and eat it. â€œThere are really basic due process steps that could be put in place that would not undermine the CDCâ€™s powers, but that would put in checks and balances so that when the powers are exercised, itâ€™s done in a way that respects civil liberties,â€ says Alexandra Phelan from Georgetown Law School.   The stickier problem is that thereâ€™s little evidence to support screening or quarantining travelers. Consider the Ebola outbreak. The CDC screened more than 38, 000 travelers flying into the U. S. by interviewing them and checking their medical records. They then monitored over 10, 000 people for 21 days. And they caught exactly zero cases of Ebola. You might ask: So what? Why take the chance? Why not ensure that weâ€™ll catch the rare exceptions in the future? Hereâ€™s the thing, and it bears emphasizing: What you think would work in an outbreak often does not work. In these situations,   â€œcommon senseâ€ can completely backfire. â€œWith Ebola,â€ says Nuzzo, screening doesnâ€™t work because â€œyouâ€™re not transmissible until youâ€™re really sick, and then youâ€™re not moving. â€ Itâ€™s telling that Thomas Duncan, a Liberian man who was diagnosed with Ebola while visiting family in Dallas, didnâ€™t spread the virus to anyone in his family or his community. He only transmitted it to two nurses who were caring for him long after it was obvious that he had Ebola. Quarantines could also have serious unintended consequences. â€œYou create the expectation that you can keep cases out by monitoring them, and thereâ€™s no evidence that we can do this,â€ says Nuzzo. If the disease does enter the country, that would seriously damage the credibility of health workers â€”  the CDC included. When doctor Richard Spencer fell sick with Ebola in New York, after having helped with the outbreak in Guinea, he was vilified. People went on a witch hunt to find all the places heâ€™d been to or eaten at, even though there was no risk of him spreading the virus at any of those places. â€œIf we start monitoring people, it enforces that message. â€ The distrust and confusion will be exacerbated if people fear that they will be quarantined unfairly cases will go underground, and diseases will spread. And if health workers share those fears, theyâ€™ll be unwilling to travel to outbreak zones to help. That happened in the last Ebola outbreak: thanks to the CDCâ€™s quarantines, the number of American health workers traveling to West Africa fell by 25 percent. Many worried that they would lose their jobs if they were isolated for weeks upon their return. Quarantine also creates severe stigma. In 2014, two   workers and a family of six Liberian immigrants were quarantined in Connecticut. â€œThough none had been exposed to Ebola or posed any threat to public health, the state confined these individuals to their homes for weeks,â€ write Roth and Edwards, who represented them. â€œThe state failed to provide these individuals with food or other basic necessities and failed to inform some that they had the legal right to challenge their quarantine orders in court. To this day, Liberian Americans in Connecticut experience shame and stigma as a result of wrongly being labeled a threat to public health. â€ By contrast, other states used far less restrictive measures, like daily phone calls with health workers. That proved to be just as effective. Rather than immediately shooting for quarantines, the CDC could amend their rule to use such options where possible.   How the CDC will react to these criticisms is unclear. They left the rule online for a   period of public comment that ended on October 14. â€œImportant people in this field did not know about this until the comment period had closed,â€ Nuzzo says. â€œIf I was the CDC, and wanted to put these regulations through and make them as good as possible, I wouldnâ€™t publish an   document and hope whoever needs to know sees it in 2 months. â€ Still, the agency received 15, 794 comments. The vast majority of these were   and incoherent, says Hodge, who reviewed them all. Around 500 to 600 were meaningful, and came from health agencies like Doctors Without Borders, legal scholars, the airline industry, and more. The CDC has to respond to these and then issue a final rule, which must be approved by senior members of the Department of Health and Human Services, and potentially by the President. In a statement, Kathy Harben, from the CDCâ€™s Division of Public Affairs, said: â€œDuring this active   period, we are unable to discuss the proposed rule or disclose how CDC will respond to the public comments. CDC will carefully review and consider each comment before publication of a final rule. â€ But Hodge says, â€œWe were given some inside information that theyâ€™re trying to push this through prior to the change in administration. â€ Thatâ€™s not comforting, given   Donald Trumpâ€™s documented responses to outbreaks of the past. During the Ebola outbreak, as I noted in a recent article, he: promoted false information about the disease repeatedly called for the U. S. to stop all flights from   countries and said that American health workers who became infected should be stopped from   the country and â€œmust suffer the consequences. â€ These statements provide little reassurance that he will respect scientific evidence or civil liberties during a future crisis. The CDC came out against travel bans at the time, but their new regulation â€”  though   â€”  might pave the way for similarly Draconian measures. â€œIts regulations inadvertently create a space for decisions that are not   and might violate constitutional liberties and principles of health ethics,â€ says Phelan. â€œItâ€™s a space where ideology can play out. â€"
73277,"Another year, another spell of films to anticipate, delight in, and dread. There will be sequels, superheroes, and Star Wars, of course, but thereâ€™s plenty else on offer from Hollywood this year â€”  and smaller projects in the hopper that are sure to surprise in the coming months. Hereâ€™s a look at some of 2017â€™s most notable projects. Split (January 20)  What It Is: M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) having rediscovered his skill at making entertaining horror schlock with 2015â€™s The Visit, is back for more with a truly absurd   act. James McAvoy plays Kevin, a menacing predator who kidnaps three teenage girls and locks them in his basement they then realize that Kevin suffers from some (entirely fictional) form of   disorder that manifests as 23 different characters in one body. If You Need Convincing: After years in the Hollywood wilderness with flops like The Last Airbender and After Earth, Shyamalan has rediscovered his mojo by tapping back into the   charm that made him a star director in the first place. Split looks like a ridiculous, but entirely   thrill ride early reviews from Austinâ€™s Fantastic Fest were largely positive. John Wick: Chapter Two (February 10)  What It Is: A sequel to one of the biggest cult surprises of the decade, this Keanu Reeves action thriller promises more of the same from 2014â€™s    sensation John Wick. Reeves plays Wick, a terrifying former hitman for the mob heâ€™s lured out of retirement for some   reason ridiculous, balletic violence ensues. Joining the cast this time around are Common, Ruby Rose, and Reevesâ€™s Matrix   Laurence Fishburne. If You Need Convincing: John Wick was one of the most genuinely electrifying things Hollywood has produced in years. It was trash, but glorious trash, with a visual panache and penchant for   that kept it from feeling disposable. It also correctly deployed Reeves, one of Hollywoodâ€™s most fascinating stars when given the right vehicle. The John Wick director Chad Stahelski is at the helm for Chapter Two, though his partner David Leitch has moved on to other projects. Hopefully lightning can strike again. The Great Wall (February 17)  What It Is: An epic fantasy drama from Zhang Yimou, one of the masters of contemporary Chinese cinema, about a gritty band of soldiers and bandits trying to protect the Great Wall of China from a monster invasion during the Song Dynasty. The most expensive Chinese film ever made, The Great Wall has already grossed a stupendous $150 million in its native country. If You Need Convincing: You may, considering the controversy that broke out last year upon the release of the filmâ€™s trailer, which emphasized Matt Damon over the other actors and drew complaints of whitewashing. Zhang and Damon have pushed back against the notion, saying the film is a historical fantasy and that Damonâ€™s character was always written as white and is one of five heroes in the film (the other four are Chinese). Whatever the case, the film may herald the dawn of a more international era in   filmmaking, since worldwide audiences are more and more crucial to Hollywood profitability. Get Out (February 24)  What It Is: A satirical horror film from the director Jordan Peele, one half of Key  Peele. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) visits his white girlfriendâ€™s family estate for the first time, he realizes that something bizarre is afoot, and frantically tries to escape after another African American in town warns him to â€œget out. â€ Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, and Bradley Whitford   as the initially pleasant, but ultimately sinister, family. If You Need Convincing: Peele is a comic genius and a   horror fan. For his debut feature (he wrote and directed) heâ€™s teamed with the veteran producer Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and many more) to make something both genuinely scary and  . Peele has described Get Out as a   Stepford Wives. Logan (March 3)  What It Is: A   to Hugh Jackmanâ€™s   performance as the mutant superhero (coming 17 years after his first appearance in  ) Logan takes place in a vaguely apocalyptic future, where the clawed menace embarks on one last effort to protect a young mutant girl. If You Need Convincing: Superhero fatigue may well have set in a long time ago for some viewers, but Logan looks like a surprisingly   intense work, uninterested in tying into another other sequels or spinoffs. Its director James Mangold made the last, highly underrated Wolverine movie this one is rated R and promises both an adult tone and an actual ending for the character. Kong: Skull Island (March 10)  What It Is: The latest attempt to revive one of the most famous monsters in Hollywood history, this King Kong take veers away from the 1930s   of the last remake (Peter Jacksonâ€™s 2005 film, which hewed closely to the 1933 original). Instead set in the â€™70s, Skull Island follows a group of explorers and soldiers who stumble across the giant ape. Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, and John Goodman star. If You Need Convincing: Another King Kong film seems painfully unnecessary, and the film is being positioned as the start of a new franchise that will eventually cross over with Godzilla. But the trailer has a surprisingly peppy,   quality to it, promising glorious fun from its monster rather than the usual grim tragedy.     Beauty and the Beast (March 17)  What It Is: An unnervingly   remake of the 1991 Disney animated classic, starring Emma Watson as the   Belle, trapped in a castle with its monstrous lord (Dan Stevens) a prince transformed into a furry beast by a witchâ€™s curse. Expect singing, dancing, and great heaps of CGI as these two crazy kids try to figure things out. If You Need Convincing: Well, Disney certainly doesnâ€™t think you will. Its   remakes of animated classics (Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book) have all been colossal successes, a good way to simultaneously appeal to older generations and younger viewers craving spectacle. From the opening bars of its score, Beauty and the Beast will play on its audienceâ€™s every nostalgic desire, and itâ€™ll capture hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. The Fate of the Furious (April 14)  What It Is: The eighth (and certainly not final) entry in the sprawling cinematic franchise that has morphed from entertaining   drama into an arcane, colorful,   series of   spy capers. After bidding a sad goodbye to Brian (the late Paul Walker) in Furious 7, Fate is charting darker territory, with hero Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) seemingly turning to evil thanks to a new character, Cipher (Charlize Theron). One imagines that all is not as it seems. If You Need Convincing: Watch the previous seven Fast  Furious films. Their convoluted evolution from   car hijinks into a   action soap opera is unlike anything in recent Hollywood history, and will bond you to the franchise. The franchiseâ€™s incredible run canâ€™t last forever, but so far itâ€™s shown no sign of slowing down. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5)  What It Is: The first of three (yes, three) Marvel movies in 2017 returns to the intergalactic fun of Peter Quill aka   (Chris Pratt) Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and all the rest. Kurt Russell is on board this time as Peterâ€™s mysterious father no doubt it will all have something to do with Infinity Stones again. If You Need Convincing: Guardians of the Galaxy is, pound for pound, the most entertaining film Marvel has ever produced, and its   James Gunn is back on board for the sequel. Also, Groot (Vin Diesel) is a little baby tree now, and if you arenâ€™t sick of seeing him in advertising yet, you will be. Alien: Covenant (May 19)  What It Is: After largely baffling audiences with Prometheus, his 2012   to Alien, Ridley Scott seems to have returned to more conventional territory with Covenant, another adventure set before his 1979   horror classic. Itâ€™s about a spaceship that stumbles on some weird eggs on a mysterious planet and then gets terrorized by an alien. Sound familiar? If You Need Convincing: Scott seems aware that he alienated viewers by veering away from the Alien formula in some ways with Prometheus. Though heâ€™s retained that filmâ€™s star Michael Fassbender (who plays dual roles here) he otherwise seems to be attempting a   of Alien, down to the new hero Danielsâ€™s (Katherine Waterston)   short hair. Baywatch (May 26)  What It Is: A shameless effort to revive another ultimate â€™90s brand, Baywatch features plenty of chiseled stars (Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, and Alexandra Daddario among them) as a team of   lifeguards. Theyâ€™ll fight crime, run around on the beach, and wink to the camera as much as possible. David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson will contribute their expected cameos. If You Need Convincing: Then youâ€™re not the â€™  demographic that studios are banking on these days. At best, Baywatch might have the knowing comic touch of Zac Efronâ€™s Neighbors films more likely, itâ€™ll resemble the director Seth Gordonâ€™s other perfunctory   efforts, like Horrible Bosses and Identity Thief. Wonder Woman (June 2)  What It Is: She fought alongside Batman and Superman last year, and now she gets a starring role. After decades of attempts, the famed Amazon warrior, certainly the most iconic female   superhero, is finally getting her own movie, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and starring Gal Gadot. A period piece, the film will explain how Wonder Woman ended up in the modern world, departing her home island to fight in World War I alongside her love interest Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). If You Need Convincing: The DC Comics film universe has been deathly grim so far, with neither Batman v. Superman nor Suicide Squad winning over critics. Wonder Woman looks far brighter and more colorful in contrast. Marvel is still yet to produce a film starring a female superhero, so look for Warner Bros. to draw as much attention as possible to Gadotâ€™s starring role. The Beguiled (June 23)  What It Is: Sofia Coppolaâ€™s first film since The Bling Ring (2013) is a remake of the 1971 Civil War drama, itself based on the Southern Gothic novel A Painted Devil. Colin Farrell will take Clint Eastwoodâ€™s original role as a Union soldier nursed back to health at an   Mississippi boarding school. Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, and Kirsten Dunst  . If You Need Convincing: Coppolaâ€™s last period film,   (2006) was a visually lush work that subverted many of the norms of the   costume drama. The 1971 version of The Beguiled is a fascinating, strange work that defies easy categorization Coppola has assembled a terrific cast to try and do the same in 2017.  : Homecoming (July 7)  What It Is: A new dawn in synergistic franchise programming, as Marvel Studios takes the reins of a character owned by Sony thanks to complicated,   bits of corporate machination. This iteration of   (played by Tom Holland) made his debut in Captain America: Civil War last year. In Homecoming, heâ€™ll fight the Vulture (Michael Keaton) in his own movie, though Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) will  . If You Need Convincing: Captain America: Civil War was a strange   of a film, but Hollandâ€™s upbeat portrayal of a teenaged Peter Parker was its most winning element. We may not need a sixth   film in 15 years, but weâ€™re getting one, so itâ€™s nice that the casting is on point. Dunkirk (July 21)  What It Is: An epic recreation of the 1940 evacuation of Dunkirk, a miraculous rescue mission that saved hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in the beginnings of World War II. The director Christopher Nolan has assembled a huge ensemble for the film, ranging from frequent collaborators Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, to legendary thespians Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh, and One Directionâ€™s Harry Styles. If You Need Convincing: Nolan is, for his flaws, one of the finest   filmmakers of the moment. Films like Inception, Interstellar, and his Batman trilogy work their hardest to deliver widescreen   without being overloaded with CGI. Dunkirk, shot entirely on   IMAX film stock, looks breathtaking, if nothing else. The Dark Tower (July 28)  What It Is: A   adaptation of Stephen Kingâ€™s famed Dark Tower series, set in the mythical   a magical spin on the Old West. Idris Elba stars at Roland Deschain, a frontier knight who wields a pair of revolvers, while Matthew McConaughey plays the filmâ€™s villain, Walter Padick. If You Need Convincing: King describes the   saga as his magnum opus, and many directors have taken cracks at adapting it, including J. J. Abrams (who eventually decided he was too fond of the work to take the necessary plot liberties to translate it to screen) and Ron Howard. Howard eventually passed it along to Nikolaj Arcel, a Danish filmmaker who made the   A Royal Affair. Whether Arcel and the books can survive the move to   Hollywood remains to be seen, but itâ€™s an exciting question. Baby Driver (August 11) What It Is: A   thriller about a young, talented getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) who works for different bank robbers and gets ensnared in trouble when a heist goes wrong. Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, and Lily James make up the rest of the cast. If You Need Convincing: Baby Driver marks the return of the   Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) to the big screen. After his last acclaimed project,   comedy The Worldâ€™s End, he was sucked into and spat out of the Marvel engine, resigning from   during   over creative differences with the studio. Wright is one of the most exciting action directors alive, so Baby Driver should be a great engine for a comeback. American Made (September 29) What It Is: Based on a true story, American Made depicts the life of Barry Seal, a TWA pilot who became a drugs and weapons smuggler for the Medellin cartel, while also working for the DEA, eventually getting mixed up in the   scandal. Tom Cruise plays Seal, with Sarah Wright, Domhnall Gleeson, and Jesse Plemons  . If You Need Convincing: Cruiseâ€™s last project with American Made director Doug Liman was the fantastic   thriller Edge of Tomorrow. The role of Seal, who seems   at best, could be a fun departure for the star, who has largely stuck to genre films in recent years (heâ€™ll also star in The Mummy this summer). Blade Runner 2049 (October 6) What It Is: Exactly what it sounds like â€”  a sequel to Ridley Scottâ€™s 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner, set in the year 2049 (30 after the events of the first film). The plot that we know is pretty simple: LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) a â€œblade runnerâ€ tasked with retiring android â€œreplicants,â€ goes on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) whoâ€™s been missing since the events of the first film. If You Need Convincing: The plot might seem like a carbon copy of another   sequel, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But the look of the film as seen in its announcement trailer is pretty   and director Denis Villeneuve made Arrival, one of the best films of 2016. Among the supporting cast are Mackenzie Davis, Jared Leto, and Robin Wright. Logan Lucky (October 13) What It Is: A comedy starring Channing Tatum and Adam Driver as brothers who plan a heist during a NASCAR race. Daniel Craig, Hilary Swank, Katherine Heigl, Katherine Waterston, Riley Keough, Seth MacFarlane, Katie Holmes, and Sebastian Stan make up the   cast. If You Need Convincing: The cast is that loaded because Logan Lucky is directed by the great Steven Soderbergh, who has ended his   retirement from filmmaking to make it. His retirement was   (only four years) but any Soderbergh project, no matter how thin the plot, is worth getting excited for. The Snowman (October 13) What It Is: An adaptation of Jo NesbÃ¸â€™s bestselling detective novel, The Snowman follows Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) as he investigates the disappearance of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around a snowman. Rebecca Ferguson, J. K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, and Chloe Sevigny  . If You Need Convincing: This project was initially attached to Martin Scorsese, but it ended up in the hands of the Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who made the delightfully moody Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Nordic mysteries have been tough for Hollywood to translate, but Alfredson might have the right touch for it. Thor: Ragnarok (November 3) What It Is: The third entry in Marvelâ€™s Thor series sees the Norse god of thunder (Chris Hemsworth) embark on some sort of intergalactic journey. His mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will surely be involved, as will the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) Cate Blanchett plays the filmâ€™s villain Hela, while Tessa Thompson is the new love interest Valkyrie (Thorâ€™s old beau, Natalie Portman, has decided she doesnâ€™t want to make any more Marvel movies). If You Need Convincing: The Thor movies are almost criminally underrated, much happier to indulge in fun mystical antics without too much needless exposition, and anchored by Hemsworth and Hiddlestonâ€™s comedic chemistry. Ragnarok has a fantastic director: New Zealandâ€™s Taika Waititi, whose What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) were cult hits. Red Sparrow (November 10) What It Is: A spy thriller starring Jennifer Lawrence, based on the 2013 novel by CIA veteran Jason Matthews that was acclaimed for its attention to detail. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a Russian intelligence officer who matches wits with a hotheaded rookie CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton). If You Need Convincing: After delivering fairly sleepy performances in  : Apocalypse and Passengers last year, Lawrence is in need of a home run. Perhaps the director Francis Lawrence (no relation) who worked with her on the Hunger Games sequels, can conjure one from her. Justice League (November 17) What It Is: Superman (Henry Cavill) Batman (Ben Affleck) Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) The Flash (Ezra Miller) and the mysterious Cyborg (Ray Fisher) unite to battle evil as DC Comicsâ€™ famed  . Zack Snyder directs from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (Argo). If You Need Convincing: Snyderâ€™s run as a   director is decidedly mixed (he made 300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, and Batman v. Superman) but he seems to have taken criticism on board. The   trailer for Justice League displayed a much lighter tone than usual for him, perhaps an acknowledgement that people actually like to have fun when they see superhero movies. Coco (November 22) What It Is: The second of two Pixar films this year (the first, Cars 3, comes out in June) Coco is an entirely original story inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead. Itâ€™s the first Pixar feature to feature a   protagonist, but little is known about the plot other than that it follows    Miguel as he finds himself in the realm of the dead. If You Need Convincing: Pixar films have a storied track record, especially their original works (which are accompanied by a depressing number of sequels these days). Cocoâ€™s director Lee Unkrich last worked on the acclaimed Toy Story 3 his   Adrian Molina, wrote the filmâ€™s script and is a veteran of the animated department. Darkest Hour (November 24) What It Is: A historical drama focusing on British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he faces down Nazi Germany and â€œfaces a crucial momentâ€ at the beginning of World War II. Sure to be an Oscar player, given its heavily   protagonist and   release date. If You Need Convincing:  The director Joe Wright (Pride  Prejudice, Atonement) is in need of a rebound after Pan, his disappointing take on Peter Pan. Alongside Oldman, the film features Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI and John Hurt as Churchillâ€™s predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Star Wars Episode VIII (December 15) What It Is: The eighth in a popular series of   films that have been kicking around Hollywood for the last few decades. Will likely make a few bucks at the box office. If You Need Convincing: At this point, you probably donâ€™t, but the still untitled Episode VIII is in the hands of Rian Johnson, a generally brilliant director behind   works of genius like Brick and Looper. Also, maybe this time Luke Skywalker will get some lines!"
73457,"This weekend, amidst a torrent of rain, one of Californiaâ€™s most iconic sequoia trees fell and shattered. Pioneer Cabin Tree was likely over a thousand years old. It had endured the last hundred as a hollow living tree, through which tourists could walk and once even drive.  My first thought was, â€œOh no. â€ I was there just a couple years ago. My second thought was, â€œOh wait. â€ Because, I remembered after furiously scrolling through my phone, the   tree we had squeezed our rental car through was actually not Pioneer Cabin Tree. It was the Chandelier Tree in Leggett, CA. Not to be confused with the other Shrine Drive Thru Tree in Myers Flat, CA. Or the other other   Tree in Klamath, CA. Or the tunnel log. Or the original   tree made famous in    photos of Yosemite National Park, which toppled under a heavy load of snow in 1969. These   were all tunneled in the late 19th or early 20th centuries. A quick scan of social media showed I wasnâ€™t the only one who confused the many   trees. Today, when redwood and sequoia trees are endangered, it seems grotesque to bore through   trees just to enchant tourists. We might imagine it to have happened once or twice â€”  but four, five, six times? How many of these mutilated redwood trees turned Instagram bait are there? And weâ€™ve only talked about the trees with holes so big you could drive through. In recent years, you were only allowed only walk, not drive, through Pioneer Cabin Tree, putting it in a lesser but still impressive category of mutilated big trees. Thereâ€™s the living Hercules Tree, where a series of steps lead to a room inside the tree. Thereâ€™s the dead and burnt giant sequoia that you can walk through in Yosemiteâ€™s Tuolumne Grove. Thereâ€™s Discovery Stump, left behind by a tree so big that five men labored for 22 days to cut it down. Its vanquishers smoothed the stump into a dance floor big enough for 40 people. This so angered John Muir, he wrote the essay titled, â€œAnd the Vandals Then Danced Upon the Stump!â€ Muir â€”  the naturalist and father of our National Parks, was of course one of those few dissenting voices in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As Muir spoke about the majesty of sequoias to save them, others talked up the giant trees to entice tourists out to see them. Itâ€™s hard to convey to a   tourist familiar only with oaks and maples exactly how otherworldly in size a sequoia is. Bore a hole and drive a car through it, and thatâ€™ll make some headlines. â€œWhat began as a crude effort to promote private toll roads and sell railroad tickets,â€ wrote the Los Angeles Times, â€œhas now evolved into a whimsical tourist trade. â€ Itâ€™s a cliche to say that photos cannot do justice to redwoods and sequoias. If youâ€™ve seen one in person, then perhaps you too have felt that urge to throw your arms around the tree, taking measure of it with your own body. But even this does not properly convey its size. Should the tree be big enough, this feels not much different than pressing your body up against a barely curving wall. No wonder we yearn to go inside and through these trees, to experience their vastness in all three dimensions. These hollowed out redwoods and sequoias, carved out long ago, still satisfy this primal urge. The irony in mourning Pioneer Cabin Tree is that the tree would likely still be standing if the tunneling had not weakened it. But an untouched sequoia eventually falling in the woods would not been remarkable either. By carving into through them, we stamped the vastness of these trees in our imaginations. The hollowed out trees still standing now are relics of another time, when human destruction of them was casual and common. That they have endured this destruction only adds to their wonder. Giants in the Face of Drought, In 1920, Muir took to the Sierra Club Bulletin to rail against the mutilation of a tree known as the Mother of the Forest. Nearly half of its bark had been stripped off, sent to the Crystal Palace to educate Londoners in the giganticness of sequoias.  The stripped tree stayed in the ground at the Calaveras Grove. â€œThis grand tree is of course dead, a ghastly disfigured ruin,â€ writes Muir, â€œbut it still stands erect and holds forth its majestic arms as if alive and saying, â€˜Forgive them they know not what they do. â€™â€"
73278,"This post was updated on January 3 at 12:24pm.   Donald Trump has shown a rare talent for leaving his own allies and friends in a difficult and awkward spot, and he demonstrated that talent again on Monday, weakly condemning a move by House Republicans to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics as a misplaced priority, while also calling the office â€œunfairâ€ â€”  a very public demonstration of why even the  â€™s strongest allies sometimes find it difficult to follow his lead. Within hours of his tweets, and amid broad public outcry, the House Republican caucus called an emergency meeting, and pulled the amendment â€”  a black eye for the congressional GOP and its leadership, perhaps made even more humiliating by the public rebuke from their own  . Trump weighed in around 10 a. m. on Tuesday, about 14 hours into a hubbub over the House move. With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it, . .... ...may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS, At first glance, it looked as if Trump was picking a fight with Congress, which to a certain extent he is. But that overstates what he actually said. Trump went out of his way to acknowledge the complaint, voiced by some members of Congress, that the ethics committee stepped on their   rights and was  . (Norm Ornstein makes the case for the committee here.) His only complaint was about the timing and priority of the move needless to say, Trump would like the House to focus first on the things that he cares about most. Trumpâ€™s tweets seem to demonstrate his keen ability to read an audience and react. They came after hours of pushback, but at a time when the fate of the amendment still seemed undecided â€”  and leaning toward survival. By stepping into the debate when he did, he may have helped tip the balance against it, but he may also have jumped in just in time to claim credit for a shift that was already underway. Put yourself in the shoes of Representative Bob Goodlatte, who on Monday put forward an amendment in the GOP Conference to gut the office. On the one hand, Trump spent the last month of the campaign claiming he would â€œdrain the swampâ€ of corruption in Washington, while Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leaders, both opposed Goodlatteâ€™s amendment. On the other hand, Trump demonstrated no public interest in fighting corruption since he got elected, and has obstinately refused to acknowledge, much less mitigate, his own conflicts of interest. It must have seemed like a safe bet that the   would look the other way. The GOPâ€™s Ethics Disaster  Thatâ€™s presumably what Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, was surmising when she went on MSNBCâ€™s Morning Joe on Tuesday and faced a series of hostile questions about the House Republicansâ€™ move Monday night. While Conway said she had not spoken with Trump about the vote, she offered a strong defense of gutting the office, saying that the GOP maintaining control of Congress meant â€œthereâ€™s a mandate there for them to make significant change. â€ Ryan was left somewhere in the middle, too. He opposed the move within the conference, but he still allowed the rules package to proceed. Shortly after Trumpâ€™s tweets, he issued a long statement trying to have it several ways. The speaker acknowledged, â€œAfter eight years of operation, many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission,â€ but he also insisted he had â€œmade clear to the new Chair of the House Ethics Committee that it is not to interfere with the Officeâ€™s investigations or prevent it from doing its job,â€ a somewhat toothless demand. Trumpâ€™s mild scolding does point to the tensions to come between the White House and the Republican Congress, which have made great efforts to project unity, despite Trumpâ€™s   departures from â€”  and sometimes flagrant disrespect for â€”  the party line. One division is on Russia, where Trump has refused to even countenance the idea that the Kremlin was involved in malicious hacking in the presidential campaign, while many GOP members of Congress see it as dangerous intervention by a hostile regime. Gutting the OCE is another case where congressional Republicans have their own interests, and intend to pursue them. After all, the GOP caucus has undercut ethics rules before the OCE was created after a series of scandals involving Republican members and members have wanted to remove that threat for some time. After calling an emergency meeting around noon, the House Republican caucus abruptly reversed course, removing the amendment to gut OCE from the rules package â€”  a reversal as sudden as the introduction of the rule. Thatâ€™s embarrassing for Goodlatte, perhaps the only member who is known to have supported the amendment, since the vote on it was private and anonymous. Ryan, whose Tuesday morning statement signaled acquiescence with his caucus, is also caught somewhat out in the open, showing that his control over members is weak. But Trump wins, as he always seems to do: He gets credit for helping sink the maneuver, imparting some â€œdrain the swampâ€ glow without his actually taking steps to fight corruption, or even to condemn dismantling ethics watchdogs. And how could he have done otherwise? Picking a real fight with Congress on ethics would carry the risk that it might have a change of heart and actually start pushing Trump for accountability on his own ethical challenges. Moving to pass the ethics rules now was a page torn right out of the Trump playbook: The theory is that you can get away with doing things that are egregious violations of norms, and even ones that might be politically toxic if handled through the typical political process, if they are instead dealt with brusquely, casually, and secretively. By the time the gutting of OCE was known, it was already passed and incorporated into the rules package, and the opponent best positioned to stop it, Paul Ryan, had already been steamrolled. But they play turned out not to work as well for the House as it has for the  . It will be much harder to pass later, after having been pulled for public outcry. The abrupt demise of the amendment suggests two lessons for Republicans in Congress: Guessing Trumpâ€™s mind is impossible, and the tactics that work for him are liable to blow up in anyone elseâ€™s face."
73305,"Advertising is screaming at us: New year, new you. New, new, new. Everything will be better when itâ€™s new. The old you was probably great, but itâ€™s harder to sell things to people who honestly believe that. The most common January undertaking in that quest is dietary â€”  shifting the actual molecules that fuel everything we do. Most of us will fail to meaningfully change, and then feel only more inadequate in that failure. We fail because absurd goals can never be maintained, and because sometimes our own bodies (partly the way we were born, but mostly the way weâ€™ve trained them to demand constant supplies of simple carbohydrates and insulin) make it almost impossible not to fail â€”  to live without feeling deprived and hungry and joyless. Maybe most importantly, many people fail when they donâ€™t truly believe in what theyâ€™re doing. The gratification of sugar is immediate, and the idea of a paralyzing stroke decades hence is remote. It seems there are more important things to worry about right now. One solution might be to think beyond yourself. Iâ€™m reminded of that because this week the good people at Bon Appetit magazine tweeted a story under the headline â€œDonâ€™t Make These Common Mistakes When Going Paleo. â€ (Tell me Iâ€™m making mistakes, and I will click every time.) The â€œPaleoâ€ approach to eating is, in brief, using evolutionary history to inform consumption. Some mistakes described in the article differed from what I think are the most important to consider â€”  for Paleo or most any diet. Their first piece of advice is to avoid eating too much saturated fat. Thatâ€™s a contentious claim packed into a paragraph of a culinary magazine. Books have been written on the subject, and many nutrition experts have come to disagree that the weight of evidence supports limiting saturated fat. (Within reason â€”  donâ€™t test them and try to subsist on lard alone.) The Paleo movement itself arose in step with the realization over the past two decades that saturated fat had been wrongly blamed by some experts as the central dietary culprit in heart disease. While other experts disagree that saturated fat intake should be unlimited (and some research has found that substituting polyunsaturated fats can be beneficial) itâ€™s unclear to many that strict limits are prudent. Iâ€™m not convinced itâ€™s worthwhile for most people to think about saturated fat at all â€”  to avoid it or to gorge on it. So here are what I see as more pressing mistakes related to Paleo, and the opportunities that those mistakes present. Eating in a way thatâ€™s not sustainable for the planet, Speaking of packing entire books into one paragraph:   animal agriculture has become a primary driver of climate change. We are eating and producing much more meat than ever before. The human population is on pace to hit 10 billion by the middle of the century thatâ€™s 10 times as many people as there were in 1800. When we find a way to grow delicious red meat in petri dishes, then we can discuss exactly how much is healthy to eat. For now, the only way forward for our species seems to be to consider meat as something closer to a delicacy. Forgetting fiber, Of all the â€œprobioticsâ€ on the market, one of the few with actual evidence that it serves our microbes well is plant fiber. Fiber is the carbohydrate that humans canâ€™t digest, yet weâ€™ve long known that people who eat   diets tend to be healthier. Among multiple studies with similar results, one with 40, 000 subjects found that a   diet came with a   lower than average risk of heart disease. Fiber also seems to protect against metabolic syndrome. One of the mechanisms behind these benefits appears to be that fiber essentially feeds the microbes in our guts, encouraging diverse populations. Those microbes are implicated in a vast array of illnesses and wellbeing. A diet heavy on meat and dairy is necessarily lower on fiber.   In that light, the idea of â€œ â€ is an interesting one. Loosely defined, it could mean eating minimally processed,   diets. If a flaw in veganism is that some people think they can drink juice and eat white bread all day and be healthy, that might be sustainable for the planet but not good for you.   (again, loosely defined lest we descend into madness trying to discern the plant varieties this would include) might work as a rule of thumb that generally keeps us focused on the sorts of foods that promote health. Rejecting the idea that technology can improve our lives, The basic idea behind Paleo is that humans evolved under certain circumstances over millennia, and then those circumstances changed tremendously in the last century, and our bodies did not keep pace. We find ourselves sedentary and overfed on amalgamations that distort our bodyâ€™s expectations of â€œfood. â€ Thereâ€™s almost no doubt these changes underlie epidemics of obesity and cardiovascular disease, but itâ€™s easy to take that reasoning too far â€”  basically to adopt a worldview in which all modern food technology is evil. It seems clear that the future of health research will involve anthropological study of our history in determining how we (and our microbes) evolved to process and prosper from food, and where weâ€™ve gone wrong in recent decades. As we come to better understand that history, itâ€™s important not to lose focus on the fact that for all its problems, our modern food system has us living longer and less deprived than centuries past. The challenge is striking balance. Telling people all about how youâ€™re â€œgoing Paleoâ€ unless explicitly asked to do so, Other peopleâ€™s diets are no more interesting than their sleep habits or their children. Breaking into a screed about your own diet shows contempt for the listener. Itâ€™s like talking about how you went to the dentist, or about something you were going to post on Facebook but didnâ€™t. Being hypocritical, Take, for instance, this advice from the Bon Appetit article: Itâ€™s a   to plan a weekâ€™s worth of dinners, but donâ€™t forget about breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Kenzie Swanhart [author of a Paleo cookbook] brings raw vegetables like carrot sticks and peppers with guacamole to work. Sheâ€™s also a fan of homemade plantain chips and   granola bars. Those all sound like fine things to eat, but the philosophy behind them is disjointed. The â€œ â€ part is based on the idea that our bodies didnâ€™t evolve to eat grains (which were not a significant part of human diets before the dawn of agriculture).   books have also been written about this, citing evidence selectively. But more compelling to me, whole grains have consistently shown to be parts of the diets of the   healthiest people. (Also is it a   to plan a weekâ€™s worth of dinners?) If you choose to avoid grains because they werenâ€™t part of an ancestral diet, then itâ€™s difficult to justify any granola bars, plantain chips, and guacamole. Unless you can point to some ancient people who ate all three of those things.  The point is, if youâ€™re going to go around talking about â€œgoing Paleoâ€ for whatever reason â€”  ritual,   adventure â€”  itâ€™s strange to be militantly inflexible about rules that are barely more than arbitrary. Lacking a meaningful reason for what youâ€™re doing, Changing the way we eat is a major change. It will involve multiple decisions every day. Presumably our old habits existed for reasons â€”  convenience, enjoyment, availability, cost, marketing, etc. Modifying the habits that these conditions created means hard work and requires dedication to a cause. Iâ€™m not convinced that concern for the health of our bodies years in the future is sufficient. Iâ€™m not even sure the promise of modifying our appearances is enough. The neurologist Viktor Frankl wrote in Manâ€™s Search for Meaning that the key is to avoid the temptation to pursue happiness â€”  like that being sold to us through all of the   deals â€”  but to pursue meaning. Piles of research have shown that a sense of purpose is a central to long, healthy life. Thereâ€™s purpose to be had in how we eat â€”  in how conscientious we can be, how minimally we can disrupt the world for those that will come after us and those working to produce and procure our food. I think this is a sustainable and worthy resolution for a healthier way to eat, if youâ€™re intent on making one. It works for the mind and body at once, and, most importantly, not just our own."
73226,"In many ways, 2016 has been the strongest year, economically, since the   or even the late 1990s. Unemployment was low. Wages were increasing. The markets hit new highs. Consumer confidence rose. Yet Donald Trump unseated the incumbent party and won the presidential election promoting economic pessimism and promising restoration: He swore to Make America Great Again, describing the country as falling behind, workers as jilted, growth as anemic, and the current period of expansion as a sham. How could a message like Trumpâ€™s take hold in an economy like that? The answer is that it did not take hold with everyone â€”  or, more to the point, everywhere. In ways that have been overlooked and   for years, the strength of the   recovery has varied dramatically not just from income bracket to income bracket, but from place to place as well. And it so happens that the places left behind are also places that wield outsized political power â€”  enough power to vault the loser of the popular vote to the presidency and to make the economic story of 2016 more about stagnation, failure, and the dissolution of the American dream than it was about the headline economic numbers. And those headline numbers were undeniably good. This year offered unremarkable but steady growth â€”  about 2 percent, the     annual pace that has characterized the Obama recovery. But over time, that     annual pace has nudged the economy to a pretty good position relative to where it was eight years ago. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4. 6 percent, its lowest level in nine years and â€œin the vicinity of maximum employment,â€ according to Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Businesses added about 2 million jobs, and measures of underemployment dropped as well. â€œItâ€™s a pretty good year bordering on a very good year in terms of jobs,â€ Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moodyâ€™s Analytics, told me. Competition for workers led businesses to boost wages, with earnings jumping faster this fall than at any other point during the recovery. â€œThe job market was pretty solid for   workers,â€ said Zandi. â€œ  hikes helped, and you saw a lot of retailers and   restaurants get ahead of those increases too. â€ Indeed, economic growth started to reach down to   and even poor families towards the end of the Obama administration. According to Census data, median household income jumped 5. 2 percent between 2014 and 2015, the first increase since 2007 (though it is still lower than it was in 1999, adjusting for inflation). Millions of people were lifted above the poverty line, with the drop in the poverty rate the biggest in a half century. Those trends are expected to continue next year. 2016 proved encouraging in financial markets as well. The total net worth of American households surged past $90 trillion, driven by a powerful buildup in the value of houses and stocks. At the national level, the housing market rose to new heights, though home prices remained below their   peak after accounting for inflation. The stock market climbed to heady new territory as well. But those aggregate,   numbers deceive as much as they elucidate. Income inequality became a dominant theme in the 2012 presidential election, given its power in explaining why steady growth and a booming stock market were leaving so many behind. Now, other sorts of disparities have taken on new importance. â€œIn the recent past, the focus on inequality has all been about where you fall in the distribution, whether in the 10 percent, 1 percent, or top tenth of a percent,â€ said Jed Kolko, the chief economist at the   website Indeed. â€œNow that discussion is shifting to differences between groups, with those groups being geographic, and also different in terms of the types of jobs available and education levels. â€ It is these geographic inequalities that help to explain why the recovery left so many voters enraged, and the peculiar structure of the American electoral system explains why that rage proved so politically potent. The recovery has been characterized by yawning gaps between the rich, the middle, and the poor. But, as Trumpâ€™s election made clear, it has also been characterized by yawning gaps between cities, the suburbs, and rural parts of the country. â€œOnce you go beneath those big, national, largely encouraging statistics, you see a lot of variation,â€ said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. â€œThis is about   cosmopolitan metropolitan areas pitted against   rural counties and some small metros. It is absolutely clear that the economic story has been much more difficult in that second group of    counties. â€ Indeed, the employment rate in rural areas was actually 2. 9 percent lower in   than it was in early 2007, just before the Great Recession started: There has been no jobs recovery in those   swaths of the country. The employment rate in metropolitan areas, in contrast, is 4. 8 percent higher than its 2007 level, and businesses are adding jobs twice as fast in urban areas as they are in rural ones. The   counties that boomed during the Clinton expansion started to lag during the Bush expansion, and really fell behind during the Obama expansion. â€œThe urban counties of large metros actually did better in the recession and recovery than they didâ€ during the   years of the 2000s, Kolko said. And some metros are doing far better than others, with New York and the Bay Area in particular booming, minting millionaires and launching new businesses. (One stark data point: Wages are so high in San Jose, San Francisco, and New York that some economists think building more housing to let more people move there would boost national economic output by an astounding 10 percent.) The story is not just about New York beating rural Illinois, but New York beating St. Louis. Government policies that had made the country more equal across regions â€”  among them antitrust protections â€”  were forgotten or rolled back in the late 20th century. And fortunes diverged. According to a report from the Economic Innovation Group, an   research and advocacy organization, the economy is growing more and more reliant on a smaller and smaller number of â€œ â€ counties, some of them in or near Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City. Just 20 counties, out of more than 3, 000 nationwide, accounted for half of the net increase in new businesses between 2010 and 2014. The number of counties seeing net job growth has dwindled, too. All in all, this adds up to, in the reportâ€™s words, â€œa massive and historically unprecedented imbalanceâ€ in geographic dynamism. The kinds of jobs in places like Dallas and Las Vegas and San Francisco, versus eastern Kentucky or   Texas or the   Dakota border, might explain why the recovery feels more durable in denser areas, too. Workers in rural areas are far more likely to be involved in industries like farming, forestry, mining, and manufacturing, sectors in which job growth has been undercut and remains threatened by offshoring and automation. â€œThese are thin economies.   â€¦     Other than the hospital or local government, there isnâ€™t a whole lot going on,â€ Zandi said. Itâ€™s just stagnation. â€ Workers in urban areas, on the other hand, are more likely to be involved in knowledge or service jobs, like corporate law or home health work, that are harder to offshore or pass off to a robot â€”  which is true even for many jobs that are not particularly  . Rural areas are lagging their urban counterparts in terms of home values â€”  the single biggest component of most householdsâ€™ net worth â€”  too. The rise in home values has been sharpest of late in coastal cities like Seattle and Boston. And the market for downtown luxury condos has recovered in a way that the market for exurban ranch homes has not, with the spoils concentrated on the high end. Data compiled by the   firm Weiss Analytics and reported by The Wall Street Journal shows that home prices in ZIP codes where the average house is worth $500, 000 to $1 million are up 39 percent since the crash in places where houses are generally worth $100, 000 to $150, 000, home prices are up just 16 percent. The   appreciation rate for houses in those cheaper, generally more rural ZIP codes is a quarter what it is for houses in those posher, generally more urban and coastal ZIP codes. As rural areas have stagnated and urban areas have become more vibrant (as well as more unequal) optimism itself has become more unevenly distributed during the recovery. According to Gallup data, people living in big cities, urban suburbs, and college towns were the most sanguine about the overall economic outlook as of 2015, and they had grown much more positive since 2009 â€”  right when the recovery started to take off for them. People living in (in Gallupâ€™s words) â€œevangelical hubs,â€ the â€œ  country,â€ â€œaging farmlands,â€ and â€œrural middle America,â€ on the other hand, were dour about the economyâ€™s prospects as of 2015, and had become only somewhat more optimistic since the darkest days of the crisis. Race and ethnicity play into the geography of the recovery too: Black and Hispanic families are more likely to live in urban areas than white families, and their representation in the workforce has grown through the recovery. As of 2015, there were 66 million white   workers with   jobs, down from 72 million in 2007. In contrast, according to Department of Labor data, the number of black   workers with   jobs remained roughly the same for Hispanic and Latino workers, it grew to 15 million from 13. 6 million. More than half of the job gains since late 2007 have gone to Hispanics, who make up 14 percent of the labor force 29 percent of the job gains went to Asians, who make up 5 percent of the labor force and 25 percent of the job gains went to blacks, who make up 11 percent of the labor force, according to an analysis from the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Demographic changes â€”  specifically, the workforce becoming less white â€”  explain much of the shift. But â€œpart of the reason may be that these jobs, predominantly in [the service sector] were created in metropolitan areas, rather than in rural areas and small towns where factories were shuttered and the manufacturing jobs disappeared,â€ the report concluded. This hardly means that black and Hispanic workers have come out ahead of white workers in the recovery. By all accounts, white Americans continue to enjoy far better economic conditions than do Americans of color. The unemployment rate for   white workers is just 3. 7 percent. For black workers, it is 7. 8 percent, and for Hispanic or Latino workers, 5. 3 percent. Moreover, the racial wealth gap sits at its worst level in a generation and, as Valerie Wilson of the   Economic Policy Institute wrote, the â€œrise in overall wage inequality [has] mechanically separated black and white workersâ€™ wagesâ€ over the past 35 years, since black workers were more likely to be working   jobs to begin with. Finally, variance in education levels has overlapped with place and race to create divergent experiences of the recovery. People in rural areas are less likely to have a college degree, and the growth in the share of people completing college has been slower in rural areas too. But job gains during the recovery have been strongest among workers with more education, with the economy adding 8. 4 million jobs for people with bachelorâ€™s degrees. Those jobs are clustered in big metro areas, not in rural ones. Taking these disparities into account, then, the state of the economy meshes well enough with the outcome of the election. On the whole, Trump voters were as likely to be employed as those who voted for Hillary Clinton. They had, on average, higher incomes. Many lived in places with an unemployment rate down in the neighborhood of 3 percent. Yet the trajectory of their communities felt far worse. Trump had extremely deep support in rural places that felt more stagnant, where the opportunities were dimmer, and where output and productivity were lower. To wit: Clintonâ€™s counties account for   of the nationâ€™s economic output, and Trumpâ€™s just a third. For many voters, that sense of stagnation and being left behind mixed with the potent forces of racial animus, sexism, cultural disdain, and political polarization. Indeed, economic hardship alone may not explain Trumpâ€™s victory so much as a desire in some regions for a more general political  . Still, in the end, place, race, and class became far more important to understanding how the economy influenced voter behavior than anything that was happening to GDP or median household income. And there are signs that that will continue to be true going forward. Democrats are sorting into       areas that are more racially diverse â€”  and hold less weight in the Electoral College. Republicans are sorting into       areas that are whiter â€”  and hold more weight. What can be done to revitalize those counties that feel left behind, that the recovery in many ways has bypassed? That is the hard part. Policy is much better at redistributing money to individuals than it is at revitalizing regions. The federal government has every lever it needs to address income inequality, and very few to address the problems of living in an economy reliant on wheat prices, coal mines, or the operation of factories. â€œWe have a well   sense of   economies,â€ said Muro of the Brookings Institution, referring to economistsâ€™ understanding of cities. â€œWhere we donâ€™t have many ideas at all is in terms of economies that donâ€™t have critical mass. One of the few ideas we have seems to be to invite people to move [to them]. â€ Economists do have a few other ideas. Infrastructure investment in struggling parts of the country â€”  building rural prisons, say, or constructing a beautiful wall through a sparsely populated desert â€”  would help, though such implementation can take time. Policies to help certain industries through tariffs or tax incentives or government stimulus â€”  punishing foreign automakers, perhaps, or subsidizing American steel companies â€”  might even things out as well, and Trump has shown a remarkable willingness to meddle in companiesâ€™ internal affairs and boost certain businesses over others. But the truth is that the forces holding rural America back and pushing urban America forward are profound ones. Just as income inequality has become a fixture in many Americansâ€™ understanding of the economy, so too must geographic inequality. And not just in election years. "
73284,"DAYTON, Ohio â€”  At a time when public anger is   on tuition charges that are rising three times faster than inflation, something less well understood has actually been largely responsible for pushing up the cost of college: fees. Think tuition is high? Now add fees for student activities, fees for athletics, fees for building maintenance, fees for libraries â€”  even fees for graduation, the bills for which often arrive just as students and their families thought they were finally done paying for their higher education. All are frustratingly piled on top of a long list of expenses beyond tuition that many people never plan for or expect, or that canâ€™t be covered by financial aid â€”  sometimes forcing them to take out more and more loans, or quit college altogether.  â€œIt was, like, what is this?â€ Ann Roach remembered thinking as she kept getting billed for fees when her oldest son went to the University of Dayton. â€œItâ€™s like buying a car. You think you have a price, and then they tell you, â€˜Hereâ€™s a conveyance fee, or hereâ€™s a fee for $200 to put the license plates on.â€™ Nobody told us about these. â€ Fees nationwide continue to increase even faster than tuition â€”  often covering the same things but letting institutions claim tuition hikes are slowing. Now, however, in response to anger from parents and students, and pressure from legislatures, or for marketing reasons in a time when theyâ€™re struggling to attract applicants, a few universities and colleges are pledging to make them more predictable or even drop them altogether. And the resulting decline in borrowing and dropout rates on those campuses suggest the significant toll that fees were taking on their students. Since the time that Roachâ€™s son went to Dayton, for instance â€”  he graduated in 2012, to be followed by two younger siblings â€”  the school has stopped charging separate fees and rolled them into tuition, which it guarantees it wonâ€™t increase for the four years an accepted applicant remains enrolled. The university was surprised to find that graduating students, in a survey, said they were â€œfeeling  â€ said Jason Reinoehl, Daytonâ€™s vice president for strategic enrollment management. â€œFrankly they were ticked off, and they were saying this on the way out of college, which should have been a celebratory time. â€ Thatâ€™s because those graduates had been charged $2, 100 annually in fees, on average, in five different bills per year, or at least 20 times per student over the course of their four years in college. Those fees included everything from counseling fees to lab fees to   fees to access to the recreation complex to a â€œ  feeâ€ in the school of business that turned out to pay for a subscription to The Wall Street Journal. â€œThis was why students were annoyed, and we needed to fix it,â€ Reinoehl said. The fees werenâ€™t necessarily lowered, but since 2013 they have been included in the tuition charge ($26, 590 this year) meaning more of them can be covered by financial aid and all are paid up front. This also encourages the university to hold the line on annual increases, which can no longer be partly hidden in fees. â€œThere are no surprises here,â€ pronounces a message splashed across the binder in which applicants receive information about how much the university will cost them to attend. The first students who were eligible for the program will graduate this spring, and the university says they have already had to borrow at least 15 percent less toward their degrees. Dropout rates have also fallen. So has the proportion of admitted applicants who fail to show up for their freshman year in September after getting their first bill. Fees still add up to plenty of surprises for students and their families on other campuses, however. One reason is that theyâ€™re hard to track. There are few sources of information on how much fees actually cost, on average. â€œTuition gets all of the media attention while fees are hidden to students and also to public knowledge and oversight,â€ said Jennifer Delaney, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at   who specializes in   finance. Those that are reported tend to be mandatory fees, not the growing number of   supplemental fees charged by individual courses or departments, such as lab fees and that   fee at the University of Dayton business school. One new study calculates that student fees at   public universities averaged $1, 719 in the   school year, the most recent for which the figure is available, adding another 27 percent to student charges on top of the typical cost of tuition. Fees have also been increasing far faster than tuition, nearly doubling at   public universities and more than doubling at community colleges since   according to that study, by Robert Kelchen, an assistant professor of education at Seton Hall University. â€œWeâ€™ve all seen the proliferation of these, with multiple fees, multiple program fees, and multiple course fees,â€ said Eric Spina, the president of the University of Dayton. Other universities, he said, tell their students, â€œâ€˜Donâ€™t worry about the extra $400.â€™ Well, the $400 three years ago was $50. â€ Students at public universities in Connecticut, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Virginia were charged $2, 500 or more in fees per year, and in Massachusetts, $8, 280, Kelchen reported â€”  nearly five times the cost of tuition in that state. Separate research at the University of Missouri found that students nationwide were being charged such things as   fees,   fees,   and   fees,   and   fees, bicycle   fees, campus   fees, â€œ â€ fees,   fees, safety fees,   fees and, at one university, a â€œ    fee. â€ Athletics fees are particularly contentious. Athletic departments at Division 1 universities and colleges got an average annual subsidy of between $3. 5 million and $4. 2 million per school from student fees in 2011, according to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. By dividing the athletic fee per student at Ohio University by the number of varsity athletic events the average student reported attending, the center found that each student there was paying $130 for each game he or she actually attended. To make things worse, fees often increase with each successive year a student is in college, in the form of such things as lab or studio fees added to the cost of increasingly advanced courses in many majors. The only way to avoid them by that point is to drop out or transfer, risking the loss of academic credits. If some of these fees sound like theyâ€™re covering exactly the same things tuition is supposed to â€”  the University of Missouri study found, at various institutions,   fees,   and   fees, education   fees, educational and technology fees, educational   fees, and   fees â€”  they are. Many have been added to make up for state budget cuts, to avoid making tuition look like itâ€™s rising too quickly, or because legislatures have ordered that tuition be frozen. In Missouri, for example, where public universities were stopped by law from raising tuition faster than inflation, schools instead increased their fees by 138 percent over six years, an investigation by the state auditor found. â€œBut they held the line on tuition,â€ Kelchen said wryly. In Massachusetts, public universities had to return their revenue from tuition to the state but got to keep the money they made from fees the result was that tuition didnâ€™t increase, but fees skyrocketed. Georgiaâ€™s Board of Regents added a $100 â€œ  feeâ€ in 2009 when state funding was cut near the start of the recession. But while the funding has rebounded, the fee remains, and has increased to $450. â€œIt really does seem like a semantic thing, that itâ€™s just another word for tuition,â€ Delaney said. One result is that     scholarships might sound as if they cover the whole cost of college, but often fall short, since they donâ€™t include fees. A merit scholarship for full tuition to public universities in Massachusetts, for example, left students to come up on their own with what was then nearly $8, 000 a year worth of fees, a Harvard study found. That further complicates the already difficult struggle to pay for a degree. â€œA focus on affordability that doesnâ€™t include predictability is really hard on students and parents,â€ said Delaney. Or, as Spina put it, universities should â€œbe right up front and tell our students: This is what you get for this price. â€ A resulting backlash has a few institutions making changes, and some legislatures ordering them to. After student complaints, the University of Kansas has reduced its athletics fee from $50 to $12 a year. The Virginia General Assembly has directed that, beginning this year, universities there reduce their reliance on student fees to support intercollegiate athletics the legislation specifically limits Old Dominion University to using student fees for 55 percent or less of its athletics budget. Old Dominion students in   paid $1, 429 each in athletics fees alone, accounting for 65 percent of the athletics budget. The Massachusetts Legislature has approved a change that lets the public universities there hold onto revenue from their own tuition. In response, starting next fall, the universities will wrap together tuition and most   fees in a single charge on a simplified bill. And at the University of Iowa, eight different fees charged by the registrarâ€™s office â€”  including transcript fees,   fees, and fees to add or drop courses â€”  were consolidated in the fall into one $225 fee. Thatâ€™s $25 less than they previously cost separately. But the main reason for the change, said the registrar, Larry Lockwood, was to help students manage their budgets by making sure they knew what charges to expect. â€œWe had to take control of this,â€ Lockwood said. One of those fees was a $100 graduation charge that Iowa, like many universities, makes its students pay before they don caps and gowns and walk across the stage to pick up their degrees. â€œHow would you like to have to pay one more fee just as youâ€™re about to graduate?â€ Lockwood asked. Among other things, the change is expected to save the university money it used to spend chasing after fees. The University of Dayton, too, says it will end up saving money, not only by avoiding having to send out 40, 000 separate bills per year for student fees, but by not having to go through the costly process of replacing students who quit school because they couldnâ€™t afford to pay the fees. Itâ€™s also an important selling point for the private Catholic university, which after a brief dip when students and their parents seemed confused about the changes, has seen a surge of applications and an increase in enrollment. â€œThis is very much about building trust,â€ said Daytonâ€™s Reinoehl. â€œItâ€™s our beacon. I think the whole industry is going to have to do this. â€ He said other schools have called to learn more about the new way the University of Dayton bundles its charges. For now, however, Reinoehl said, in much of the rest of higher education, there remains â€œa trend to charge more fees, not fewer. â€ Students on the campus outside his window count themselves among the few American college and university students who live in blissful innocence of that. One, Laylah Funk, said her friends at other schools â€œwere blown away when I told them we donâ€™t have to pay for health services or counseling. â€ Renee Brown, who has two siblings at other colleges, said theyâ€™re constantly being hit with fees. â€œYou think youâ€™ve paid for everything and then some fee comes up out of nowhere,â€ Brown said. Studying in a quiet corner of the library on a frigid Ohio morning,   major Ryan Berry was asked what itâ€™s like to not have to pay for all of those fees his counterparts at most other colleges and universities face. Berry responded with a quizzical look. â€œI didnâ€™t know that was actually a thing,â€ he said. This post appears courtesy of The Hechinger Report."
73302,"Over the next few weeks, Republicans will probably vote to repeal Obamacare. Though Republicans and vice   Mike Pence are huddling to come up with replacement plans, the general framework of action over the immediate term seems clear. Republicans will likely delay its   so as to not immediately cancel millions of plans and â€œcreate a transition and bridge so that no one is left out in the cold,â€ as per Speaker Ryan. Barring defections, Democrats have little power to stop them. Thereâ€™s one big problem with this approach, however. While the â€œrepeal and delayâ€ tactic seems like a way to keep people from becoming suddenly uninsured or having to make inconvenient changes â€”  or to keep kicking the can down the road â€”  in reality the mere announcement of a   repeal or pledge to end government support for   markets could cause severe disruptions in how those markets operate. And those disruptions could mean turmoil for millions of people. Obama: The Ocean President  The secondary currency of any insurance market is risk â€”  or the amount plans can be expected to pay in claims for each beneficiary. Originally, insurers hedged against risk by finding healthy patients and charging sicker patients more or denying them coverage altogether. Obamacare effectively eliminated many of those hedges by creating qualifying health plans, by removing lifetime spending caps, and by prohibiting companies from refusing to insure based on   conditions bans. In order to make the health plans work work and entice health insurance companies to participate in the health insurance exchanges, Obamacare mandates healthier people to join and offset sicker peopleâ€™s costs, and also uses federal money to offsetting risky bets in several different ways. Those shopping for plans on the exchanges are often inherently risky bets, and only federal funding and the promise of more such funding in the future keeps insurers insuring them. Even in 2016 before Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency became viable and the threat of an Obamacare repeal became real, the exchanges had grown increasingly unstable and brittle. The administration had difficulty in attracting younger, healthier people to sign up, so enrollees were sicker and riskier than expected. Although stakeholders expected risk to be high as the country adjusted to a   healthcare paradigm and the individual mandate pushed stragglers into exchanges, Congress later authorized lower payments than expected to offset that risk. The   premium increases of exchange plans and the withdrawal of major insurers like Aetna were signs of this inherent instability. Although they are certainly fixable problems, fixing them requires money, which requires action by Congress. Though some of this instability can be attributed to hype from insurers seeking to maximize government subsidies and payments to offset risk, several firms do run in the red now with the expectation that theyâ€™ll be in good position to make money when the market settles down. Whatâ€™s the incentive for them to continue to insure people if they believe the market will no longer exist â€”  or if they believe that the tax credits in a Republican replacement plan are less than what they receive now? Insurance plans have to decide by May of 2017 if theyâ€™ll participate in the exchanges, and it might not be a surprise to see insurers with smaller enrollee bases or higher losses bow out. Also, those plans that do stay can pass on the costs of increased uncertainty in the markets in the form of increased premiums, which would cost the federal government and enrollees even more money. At MarketWatch, former   executive J. B. Silvers explains how this might all work in practice: Some in Congress seem to think that passing the â€œrepealâ€ part immediately but delaying its implementation for two or three years will somehow leave everything as it is now. But this naive notion misses the fact that the riskiness of the Obamacare individual insurance exchange markets will have been ramped up to such a level that continuing makes no sense. Even if a company reaches   in the â€œdelayâ€ years, it will lose when the repeal is effective. If the premium subsidies now available to   enrollees go away immediately and the mandate to sign up for an insurance plan disappears, then the number of people purchasing individual policies on the exchanges will drop like a rock. In fact, it is clear that even debating this scenario is likely to be   since insurers must decide on their participation for 2018 by the late spring of 2017. Look for many to leave then. A plan to repeal and delay would also likely have some effects on the individual mandate to purchase insurance. If that plan immediately eliminates the mandate, the final lever to maintain the health of exchange risk pools evaporates, and there will be much less impetus for healthier, younger people to participate in them. Even if the plan phases the mandate out over time, news of a repeal might be easily misconstrued as eliminating the mandate, which could still spur millions of healthy people to leave the exchanges and penalize them at tax time next year for doing so. At the same time, even the rumor of a repeal can send millions of sicker people into the exchanges to receive some kind of vital services before the well runs dry, which are bound by law to cover them. In fact, this may already have happened. As long as an indefinite purgatory between repeal and replacement exists, adverse selection will be impossible to fix, as would be the â€œdeath spiral. â€ The   scenario would be the   withdrawal of insurers from markets and the inversion of risk pyramids, with sicker and sicker patients seeking coverage while they can. Without available insurers or a public option, people without employer coverage or who make too much to qualify for Medicaid might just not have any insurance to buy. If Congress and state governments donâ€™t actively enforce â€œrate reviewâ€ and   ratio rules that give states oversight over large premium increases and mandate that insurance plans spend a certain percentage of premiums on healthcare, insurers could enter markets that donâ€™t have plans and raise premiums for vulnerable people who need insurance most. Alternatively,   insurers â€”  which already profit on the mandate despite providing barebones services that donâ€™t qualify as full plans â€”  could continue to fill in the gaps. Millions of people in the exchanges may have to change insurance or enter the ranks of the uninsured. And though the delay may not immediately affect people with employer coverage or public coverage, downstream challenges for insurers in exchanges could affect the products they offer for those markets. None of this would be good politically for Republicans, who already have to contend with a voter base that actually kind of likes having insurance. Compare that scenario to the political damage that Democrats suffered in the 2016 elections over much less dire and   problems. Republicans could pin these woes on Obamacare itself, but then their inability to fix those woes despite campaigning on promises to do just that could come back to haunt them. As conservative   American Enterprise Institute reports, the fact that Republicans are aware of the destabilizing effect that a delay might cause and intend to build a reform in increments indicates that there isnâ€™t really a plan in place. But the longer the delay goes, the more political capital will have to be expended in fixing the issues that it causes. A piecemeal plan with a delay could also exacerbate the instabilities in the marketplace, and continue to widen gaps in the current healthcare system. The market risk grows with each day without a clear picture of what comes next, and many people who have children, lose jobs, lose spouses or have other serious life events in the interim will be placed at the mercy of a volatile market, where   plans might evaporate, subsidies may suddenly dry up, or death spirals may collapse entire markets altogether. What comes next for them?"
73414,"Updated on January 9 at 5:27 p. m. Jared Kushner is a man who has been in the right place â€”  or more precisely, the right families â€”  at the right time, and been willing and able to bend the rules to move forward. In the latest instance of that pattern,   Donald Trump will reportedly name Kushner a senior White House adviser, CNN and The New York Times report, placing his    in a top post but setting up a potential showdown over the reach of federal nepotism laws. That would end weeks of speculation that Kushner would receive a top job at the White House, and it would represent a continuation of his role on the Trump presidential campaign, where Kushner gradually grew in influence, ultimately becoming one of his   â€™s closest aides. Ivanka Trump, Kushnerâ€™s wife, will take a formal role in the administration, CNBC reports. As soon as rumors of a Kushner appointment bubbled up, ethics experts objected, saying his playing a role in the White House would fall afoul of rules instituted in 1967, partly in response to John F. Kennedy naming his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, as attorney general. But there are ways around the law. The statute specifies: A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. The law defines agency as â€œan Executive agency,â€ â€œan office, agency, or other establishment in the legislative branch,â€ â€œan office, agency, or other establishment in the judicial branch,â€ or â€œthe government of the District of Columbia,â€ and itâ€™s the meaning of those definitions on which Kushnerâ€™s eligibility for his new job hinges. Ironically, itâ€™s Hillary Clinton who might bail Trump out here. When Bill Clinton named the first lady to lead a   task force in 1993, the appointment was challenged in court as a violation of the act. But the court concluded that the White House and Executive Office of the President didnâ€™t fall under the statutory definition. Will that work for Kushner? Opinions diverge, even between Norm Eisen and Richard Painter, who have emerged as the most consistent voices assailing Trumpâ€™s ethical practices. â€œWeâ€™re not talking about Kushner running a side task force here,â€ Eisen, who was Obamaâ€™s chief ethics lawyer, told Politico in November. â€œWeâ€™re talking about a regular staff job. This falls right in the bullâ€™s eye of the statute. I think itâ€™s illegal. â€ But Richard Painter, who held the same position for George W. Bush, told ABC News that same month that while a Kushner job â€œclearly violates the intent of the law,â€ there are also â€œarguments that could be used to try and wiggle around it if you were making an appointment in the White House. â€ The likely ascent to a job at the presidentâ€™s right hand represents the latest piece of good luck and good timing for Kushner, a spree that began with his birth as the scion of a prominent New York area   family â€”  a parallel between Kushner and Donald Trump that has not been overlook. Kushner was also lucky in marriage, with his union with Ivanka Trump bringing him into another prominent New York   empire. The attempt to circumvent nepotism statutes points to another characteristic of Kushnerâ€™s career: Heâ€™s been willing and able to have rules bent on his behalf. In a 2006 book on how colleges court wealthy donors, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Daniel Golden reported that Jared Kushner was likely admitted to Harvard on the basis of a lavish gift that his father Charles made to the Ivy League college. Golden recapped his reporting in a recent ProPublica piece: â€œThere was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard,â€ a former official at The Frisch School in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. â€œHis GPA did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not. â€ During the course of the campaign, Kushner gradually came to be seen as a more and more powerful figure. He helped shape Trumpâ€™s Middle East policy and his March 2016 speech to AIPAC, an outing that was seen as surprisingly sober and prepared for a candidate mostly characterized by chaos and disorder. He was said to have a role in the June firing of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who, according to some reports, had sought to plant negative stories about Kushner. But although Kushner is an observant orthodox Jew, he emerged as a major backer of Steve Bannon, the emissary of the â€œ â€ who became Trumpâ€™s final campaign chairman and is headed to the White House as its top strategist. Kushnerâ€™s hand is said to be at work in the falling fortunes of Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor who was an early backer of Trump. Christie, then a U. S. attorney, sent Jared Kushnerâ€™s father Charles to jail for two years in a rococo case, in which Charles hired a prostitute to solicit his sisterâ€™s husband, then taped the encounter and sent a recording to the sister. Christie was dethroned as head of the transition shortly after Trumpâ€™s election, and has thus far been shut out of a post in the Trump administration. Although Kushner has little experience in politics or government â€”  he is the owner of the New York Observer, a weekly newspaper that has historically focused on media, real estate, and the doings of New York Cityâ€™s chattering classes â€”  he is well connected in business circles. Kushner was reportedly a major advocate for Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs who has been appointed as the head of Trumpâ€™s National Economic Council. Kushner has already been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As Andrew Rice reports in a new profile in New York, the parallels between Donald Trump and Jared Kushner do not end with their backgrounds as the sons of major Gotham developers. Trump was for many years a Democrat and espoused standard liberal positions before taking his   turn ahead of his presidential campaign. Kushner, like Ivanka Trump, seems to have been a fairly typical   Democrat until recently â€”  indeed, when his father was sentenced to jail, the New York Times headline identified him first and foremost as a â€œDemocrat Donor. â€ More recently, associates told Rice that Kushner had taken a hard turn right. Even if nepotism laws can be overcome, Kushner risks running afoul of other White House rules. Because of his role running his familyâ€™s   company, Kushner is deeply enmeshed with a variety of business interests that could conflict with his role in policymaking. A deeply reported Times story on Sunday looked at the Kushner companies and how they intersect with, among other things, Chinese national interests. Despite Trumpâ€™s belligerent words about China, a joint   venture in New Jersey was financed in part with a maneuver that allows major overseas investors, in this case many of them Chinese, to get U. S. visas. These connections could cause problems for Kushner. Or he could take the approach that Donald Trump has taken as   and simply refuse to acknowledge the deep conflicts of interest or do anything about them. If Kushner did that, it would be yet another case of like father, like   ."

Trump Takes Questions: The   this morning held his first press conference in six months, in which he announced a new plan to address his conflicts of interest and then conceded for the first time that Russia was likely involved in cyberattacks on the U. S. He also dodged questions about his business ties in Russia and renewed his refusal to release his tax returns. Trumpâ€™s   presser came amid uproar over a report last night of unverified claims that Russian agents had compromising information about him. Whether or not that dossier is accurate, it raises worrying questions over intelligence and troubling risks for the mediaâ€™s credibility. Tillerson Talks: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson testified before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The former CEO of ExxonMobil has controversial business ties to Russia and other foreign governments, and his questioners pressed him particularly hard on Russia. He also expressed support for measures to address climate change, though he downplayed humansâ€™ role in creating the problem. Read all our updates on todayâ€™s confirmation hearings here. Obamaâ€™s Farewell: The outgoing president gave his last speech to the nation from Chicago last night. In addition to thanking his family, staff, and voters, he looked back on Americaâ€™s last eight years of economic progress â€”  and also warned against threats to democracy posed by intolerance and discrimination. That warning implied a strong criticism of Trump, and on that point itâ€™s worth noting that Obama set a precedent for violations of civil liberties that his successor will now inherit. Still, the defining message of the speech was of faith in the enduring ideals of America â€”  a nation thatâ€™s flawed but filled with hope, empathy, and the ability to change for the better. Ed Yong on a breakthrough in the search for the origin of complex life: To understand this story, we have to go back to the very beginning. The Earth was created around 4. 5 billion years ago, and judging by some astonishingly ancient fossils, life emerged relatively soon after. For the longest time, living things belonged to two great domains: the bacteria and the archaea, both microscopic and both comprising single cells. That was the status quo for at least 1. 7 billion years, until the two domains were joined by a third: the eukaryotes. And they were very different. Eukaryotic cells are generally much bigger than either bacteria or archaea. They also have larger genomes. They have internal compartments that act like our organs, each with its own special job. They have an internal skeleton that acts as a transport network for molecules. Thereâ€™s this huge gulf of complexity that separates them from the other two domains. Itâ€™s a gulf that has only ever been crossed once in lifeâ€™s history. Bacteria and archaea are capable of amazing feats of evolution, but in over 3. 7 billion years of existence, none of them have ever evolved into anything approaching a   cell â€”  except that one time.

In our September 1965 issue, Elizabeth Drew explained why: Behind the facade of a requirement for printing a warning on cigarette packages (which is not expected to deter smoking much) Congress tied the hands of the Federal Trade Commission by forbidding it to proceed with its own plans to apply much more stringent regulations. Had it not been for Congress, the FTC, which is charged with preventing unfair and deceptive trade practices, would have required a warning both on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising. The effect of the advertising regulation is what the cigarette industry most feared Congress obliged by forbidding it for at least four years. In another remarkable provision, the law prohibits state and local governments from taking any action on cigarette labeling or advertising. It is one thing for Congress to prohibit the states from enacting legislation which overlaps and is inconsistent with its own requirements, as in the case of the labeling, but it is a far different thing for Congress to refuse to act, and to prohibit the states from acting, as in the case of cigarette advertising. Read the whole story on the power of the cigarette lobby here, and read more here about Drewâ€™s remarkable career. Did you change your mind about Obama during his presidency? Michael voted against him eight years ago, but came to support his   reform efforts: In 2008, Hillary Clintonâ€™s bruising primaries against President Obama misled me to John McCain. Also, I genuinely wanted to see a Vietnam War veteran win the presidency, after John Kerry had gotten   by the Bush campaign in 2004. My profound ignorance of Sarah Palin did not help. For the first and only time in my life, I backed a Republican candidate for president. After that, the emergence of the Tea Party and Obamaâ€™s basic moral decency in championing health care reform turned me sharply against the GOP.   â€¦     The 2010 midterms, the sequester, the threatened government shutdowns, the obstructionism, the   and the failure of Speaker Ryan to pass a budget â€”  it all cemented for me a deep disdain for Congressional Republicans. I voted   Democratic in 2012. Speaking of Obamacare, its future is stalling in Congress yet again, as Republicans eager to repeal the law run into more and more logistical hurdles.

73220,"There was a time, half a century ago, when what was good for many American corporations tended to also be good for America. Companies invested in their workers and new technologies, and as a result, they prospered and their employees did too. Now, a growing group of business leaders is worried that companies are too concerned with   profits, focused only on making money for shareholders. As a result, theyâ€™re not investing in their workers, in research, or in technology â€”    costs that would reduce profits temporarily. And this, the business leaders say, may be creating   problems for the nation. â€œToo many CEOs play the quarterly game and manage their businesses accordingly,â€ Paul Polman, the CEO of the   conglomerate Unilever, told me. â€œBut many of the worldâ€™s challenges can not be addressed with a quarterly mindset. â€ Polman is one of a group of CEOs and business leaders that have signed onto the American Prosperity Project, an initiative spearheaded by the Aspen Institute, to encourage companies and the nation to engage in more   thinking. The group, which includes CEOs such as Chip Bergh of Levi Strauss and Ian Read of Pfizer, board directors such as Janet Hill of Wendyâ€™s and Stanley Bergman of Henry Schein, Inc. and labor leaders such as Damon Silvers of the   have issued a report encouraging the government to make it easier for companies to think in the   by investing in infrastructure and changing both the tax code and corporate governance laws. â€œAmericaâ€™s incentive system for   investment is broken,â€ the report argues. Data bears this out. The average holding time for stocks has fallen from eight years in 1960 to eight months in 2016. Almost 80 percent of chief financial officers at 400 of Americaâ€™s largest public companies say they would sacrifice a firmâ€™s economic value to meet the quarterâ€™s earnings expectations. And companies are spending more and more on purchasing their own shares to drive stock prices up, rather than investing in equipment or employees. Polman, who has been the CEO since 2009, told me that he sees business leaders managing spending from quarter to quarter, and pushing sales at the end of quarterly reporting periods if numbers are off. (This dynamic backfired at Wells Fargo, where employees pressured to meet quarterly targets opened accounts without customersâ€™ permission.) Companies engage in â€œfinancial manipulation,â€ he said, to post better quarterly profits, and donâ€™t spend money on costly investments that might make their businesses do better in the long term. Business leaders, afraid that shareholders will oust them if quarterly profits dip, aim for earnings at the expense of anything else. (For an   look at one company that slashed research at the demands of  investors, read my story on DuPont.) â€œThe strategy ends up being focused on the shareholders versus other stakeholders,â€ he told me. â€œIf ultimately the purpose of a company is maximizing shareholder return, we risk ending up with many decisions that are not in the interest of society. â€ There are a few reasons why   has become more prevalent in America. Thereâ€™s a growing culture of analysts and traders obsessing over a companyâ€™s quarterly performance, and panicking if a company posts poor quarterly results. This culture has been enabled by the availability of information about companies on the Internet and television, but it has also arisen because tradersâ€™ compensation is tied to how their holdings perform every year. The recession amplified this culture â€”  so many funds lost money during that time period that they, too, began encouraging the people who manage their money to try and make it up in the short term. Often shareholders advocate against leaders of companies that may post a year of poor profits, even if that company could perform very well over a   period. CEOs and other executives often have their pay tied to annual performance, meaning they personally benefit from   profits too. The Aspen Institute and its signatories have come out with a framework that they hope will discourage this kind of   thinking.   thinking is bad for America, they say, because the countryâ€™s economic health depends on   investments that will pay out over time. Whatâ€™s more, they argue,   thinking shouldnâ€™t be paramount for the majority of investors most equity is held by pension funds and other institutional investors who need their assets to perform well over the long haul. Large institutions hold nearly 70 percent of all equity issued in public markets today, up from 8 percent held by such institutions in 1950. Many of the recommendations revolve around the policies that influence how companies spend their money. Currently, for instance, companies can defer taxes on foreign income until they repatriate that income, which discourages them from bringing the money back into the U. S. If the U. S. taxed multinational firms based on the share of worldwide sales that occur in the U. S. (a policy called formulary apportionment) that might discourage firms from locating operations overseas simply to lower their tax burden. Another tax change would be to allow â€œbonus depreciation,â€ a policy that would allow half of investment in equipment to be deducted immediately, rather than over a period of time. This was a policy enacted during the stimulus a 2013 bill sponsored by Harry Reid proposed making it permanent. The signatories also call for increased government spending so that companies can feel secure that theyâ€™re operating in a country that supports investment and productivity. This includes $200 billion of infrastructure investment per year. â€œIf the airports are crummy and basic transportation is inadequate, weâ€™re not supporting the system that makes it possible for goods and people to move easily,â€ Judy Samuelson, the executive director of the Aspen Instituteâ€™s business and society program, told me. The government could also raise money for research through a financial transactions tax, which would simultaneously curb the rapid trading done by some on Wall Street to earn quick money rather than invest in companies for the long term, the report argues. Some of the recommendations focus on other ways to incentivize investors to hold onto assets for longer. Currently, assets held for less than one year are taxed as income but assets held for a year or more are treated as   investments and taxed at a lower rate of 15 percent. Increasing the amount of time that investors must hold an asset so that it can be taxed as a   holding could encourage more investors to think about the   the report argues. An alternative would be to tax holdings on a gradual scale, in which assets held for a short time are taxed at a higher rate, and those held for a long time are taxed at a lower one. Perhaps most compelling of the American Prosperity Project recommendations are those that companies can undertake on their own. After all, Congress has been and will likely be locked in gridlock going forward, and itâ€™s doubtful it will take up bills that address corporate taxation or tax incentives in the new session. So instead there are recommendations in the report that individual companies can implement, if they truly want to put an end to  . They include giving enhanced shareholder voting rights to investors who hang onto stocks for the long term, and voting on executive pay in a longer time frame so that executivesâ€™ incentives arenâ€™t aligned with the need to post big quarterly gains. They also include discouraging   earnings guidance so that companies can focus more on the long term. Companies can, after all, refuse to issue earnings guidance, and only share financial information when they issue quarterly reports and other financial statements. There are a few companies that have already tried to undertake some of these recommendations on their own. Unilever is one. When Polman became CEO, in 2009, he told investors that Unilever would stop issuing quarterly earnings guidance so that the company could focus more on the long term. The market punished Polman for doing so According to Bloomberg, Unilever stock dropped 22 percent after his announcement compared to the 16 percent experienced by The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. Since then, the company has taken on some   ideas, buying companies including Seventh Generation and Dollar Shave Club, and investing over a billion dollars in its U. S. factories. It may be difficult to get other companies to follow. After all, few other company CEOs likely have a worldview similar to that of Polmanâ€™s, who is   for his independent streak. â€œUltimately, the purpose of a company is to serve society, and in doing so shareholders will equally benefit over time,â€ he told me. Many heads of companies, by contrast, believe that they have a duty to serve shareholders, and hope that the company will benefit over time. This is a mistaken assumption â€”  as Cornell professor Lynn Stout has argued in her book, The Shareholder Value Myth: How Putting Shareholders First Harms Investors, Corporations, and the Public. CEOs think they have to put shareholders first, but they can put the interests of society first, if they choose. Still, many CEOs personally benefit when they act on behalf of shareholders the way they are paid and evaluated depends on   success. Itâ€™s likely that their incentives will need to change before they act to stop   on their own."
73318,"It was only eight years ago that the United States had just one president at a time. Yet those days have felt much more distant over the past two months as the   Donald Trump, has set about merrily reshaping U. S. policy 140 characters at a time. Tuesday evening saw what might turn out to be one of his more consequential Twitter proclamations. In a New Yearâ€™s address, North Koreaâ€™s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, had stated that his country had â€œentered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile. â€ In response, Trump tweeted that â€œNorth Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It wonâ€™t happen!â€ How to Stop a Nuclear Missile, If Trumpâ€™s tweet is to be taken literally â€”  and perhaps, as the saying goes, it should be taken seriously but not literally â€”  he appears to have committed to preventing Kim from acquiring the capability to threaten the United States with a   missile, as opposed to necessarily stopping the test that Kim says he is planning. Yet, regardless of Trumpâ€™s actual intentions, the tweet could come to be seen as a â€œred lineâ€ and hence set up a potential test of his credibility. Much will depend, of course, on whether Trump subsequently doubles down on his pledge, but now that the tweet is out there, he has only limited influence on how it is viewed by North Korea, U. S. allies, and the American people. Past U. S. presidents have discovered that red lines against North Korea are easy to set but difficult to enforce. On June 29, 2006, when North Korea was preparing to test another   missile, President George W. Bush declared that launching it would be â€œunacceptable. â€ Not only did Pyongyang go ahead with the launch anyway, but it did so on July 4. North Korea crossed other U. S. red lines too that year. In October, Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in spite of a warning by Bush, a year earlier, that â€œa   North Korea will not be tolerated. â€ The United States has been putting up with the Kim dynastyâ€™s possession of nuclear weapons ever since. Over the last year, North Koreaâ€™s   efforts have made significant progress due to an unprecedented level of testing. Unless those efforts are somehow checked, there can be little doubt that, even without foreign assistance, they will result in a   intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) â€”  though there is some uncertainty about timing. It is difficult to conceive how Trump could enforce his red line â€”  if that is what he decides to do â€”  without ultimately reaching a negotiated settlement or authorizing   military action. The other policy tools he might try to wield â€”  economic sanctions, pressure from China, military threats, and even limited strikes (such as blowing up a missile on the launch pad) â€”  are not ends in themselves. They might be able to provide the United States with leverage at the negotiating table. If they donâ€™t, they could provide justification for a major attack. By themselves, however, they cannot deny North Korea a   ICBM indefinitely.   military action would be fraught with risks, of which two stand out. First, strikes against North Korean   missiles and their production infrastructure â€”  the absolute minimum target set required to enforce Trumpâ€™s red line â€”  would risk terrible retaliation. Seoul, for example, is within reach of a prodigious quantity of North Korean artillery. U. S. bases in Japan could be hit by   North Korean missiles, some of which may already be  . Broadening the target set to include more North Korean military assets would merely increase Pyongyangâ€™s incentives to employ whatever survived in even less discriminate ways. Second, after a strike, North Korea could â€”  and almost certainly would â€”  attempt to rebuild its missile force. As a result, the United States would either need to occupy the country or else launch periodic strikes to â€œmow the grass. â€ Diplomacy, then, is the better option, though â€œbetterâ€ is a relative term. In theory, Trumpâ€™s goal could be met if North Korea agreed to suspend nuclear and   missile tests in return for some    concessions from the United States. This approach would stop North Korea from developing a   ICBM through trial and error. And, while it would not stop theoretical and   research, it would severely curtail the reliability of any resulting weapon. In practice, the challenges to even reaching â€”  let alone enforcing â€”  a deal are manifold. For starters, it is far from clear that North Korea actually wants a deal, at least at any price that the United States and its allies might be willing to pay. Diplomacy would probably be more difficult if North Korea asked â€”  as it might well do â€”  for an end to joint U. S.  Korean military exercises or a peace treaty to replace the armistice that stopped the Korean War but didnâ€™t formally end it, as opposed to economic aid. In return for such   concessions, South Korea might want much more on disarmament from North Korea than just a testing moratorium â€”  though how much Trump would take Seoulâ€™s concern into account is an open question. Moreover, even if a reasonable quid pro quo can be reached, there is the surprisingly thorny question of how to define a   missile. On February 29, 2012, Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on nuclear and   missile tests (among various other measures) in return for food aid from the United States. Only 16 days later, North Korea announced plans for a satellite launch, which the United States argued was an ICBM test in disguise. The deal fell apart shortly thereafter. Then there is the challenge of negotiating the timetable for the dealâ€™s implementation. To maintain as much leverage over North Korea as possible, the United States is likely to want to provide whatever concessions it agrees to make only after a prolonged period of compliance by Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to argue that it canâ€™t trust Washington to cough up later and that it should be rewarded early. Yet in spite of these and other challenges, there is really very little reason for the great dealmaker not to try his hand at diplomacy with Pyongyang. In the very best case, he could prevent the emergence of a grave new threat to the United States indefinitely. More plausibly, he could delay it by a few, potentially valuable years. Even in the    worst case â€”  that no deal is reach or it falls apart almost immediately â€”  it is hard to see what the United States would lose from trying. Besides, if it all goes wrong and North Korea successfully demonstrates a   ICBM, Trump could always just deny he said it wouldnâ€™t happen."
73285,"Can we agree on this much? Twitter was terrible in 2016. Too many tweetstorms, too many Russian   too much game theory. For the blank slate of 2017, may I suggest you follow the   anniversary of the Cultural Revolution in real time. Fifty years ago this past May, Mao Zedong declared the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in 2016, someone had the idea to livetweet that tumultuous period on a   delay. @GPCR50 has about 1, 500 followers, which is frankly on the low end of modest. But Iâ€™ve been one of its avid followers because this was an uncanny year to see the events of the Cultural Revolution swirled together with the 2016 election in my feed. Violence simmered over at Trump rallies. Red Guards attacked their teachers in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping made   in deference to Mao. Newt Gingrich declares â€œI made a big boo booâ€ in suggesting Trump did not plan to drain the swamp. The surreal past met the surreal present. Anyways, I donâ€™t want to draw tidy parallels between the Cultural Revolution and America in 2016 because, obviously, so much does not run parallel. But in a time when voters have shown casual eagerness to blow up a system that isnâ€™t working for them, at at time when Trump can ask, â€œWhat do you have to lose? ,â€ @GPCR50 was a daily reminder by tweet of just how much we have to lose. Weâ€™ve had relative order and stability for so long. Chaos is a foreign country. I confess to being no expert either here. As a kid, most of my awareness of the Cultural Revolution came from stories from my parents, who were born in China around that time. And like the fairy tales a parent might tell, these stories had a kind of unlogic they seemed no more real to me than a fairy tale. A man, for example, rides home with a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his bike. The rope holding the portrait in place just happens to go across Maoâ€™s neck. This is a sign of disloyalty. He is mobbed and killed. What the hell? Yet @GPCR was a constant stream of   violence. Mao directed the Red Guards, which grew out of   students in Beijing, to attack the â€œFour Oldsâ€ â€”  old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. In effect, this meant the destruction of books, museums, temples, and shrines, as well as the people who stood for them.   students turned on their teachers and killed them.    Middle school Red Guards beat Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun with   clubs. She passes out and is dumped in a rubbish cart.    Daxingâ€™s local brigade buries undesirables alive. â€Granny, Iâ€™m getting sand in my eyesâ€ says a girl aged 8. â€Soon you wonâ€™t feel itâ€.    Red Guards resort to using dynamite to open Confuciusâ€™ tomb. But when they peer into the crater, nothing discernibly human is left. And for a certain period in August, the @GPCR50 was just death count:    Red Guards killed 200 people in Beijing today.    Red Guards killed 224 people in Beijing today. The man behind @GPCR50 is Jacob Saxton of Southampon, U. K. whom I phoned one recent afternoon to talk about his Twitter creation. Saxton is a not a historian â€”  he is a logistics analyst by day â€”  but he has an interest in modern Chinese history and was reading Maoâ€™s Last Revolution last year. He noticed the 50 years that passed and no one else was chronicling the period. So he decided to. The one book soon grew to a stack, and Saxton now plans out tweets month by month in a â€œsort of slightly shoddy Excel spreadsheet. â€ In August, when the   violence was reaching its peak, he had to take a few days off work to catch up on the tweets. â€œItâ€™s a lot more time than I realized at the beginning,â€ he says. Some of the tweets can, admittedly, be a bit abstruse if you are not already familiar with the cast of characters. But the best tweets capture some small measure of humanity. One of Saxtonâ€™s favorite stories involves a fruit basket, which he actually didnâ€™t get to tweet in real time because he read about it too late. (A hazard of his   process.) Iâ€™ll let him tell it himself now: Right at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Mao got rid of Peng Zhen, who was the mayor of Beijing.  He was quite close to Liu Shaoqi, the president. Liu went out on a big foreign trip during the time when the purge of Peng Zhen was happening, and he was so in the dark about this â€”  the way Peng had gone from the mayor of Beijing, this really important guy, to pariah â€”  he came back with a beautiful fruit basket for Peng. Only on the last leg of the journey did he found out how much things have changed. Itâ€™s quite a funny image to imagine him trying to hide this fruit basket. In tweeting out these events in real time, Saxton has also gotten to experience them in real time. â€œI thought the saddest bit were the way you could see this violence creeping towards people â€”  people who you might read about having died on a certain day in the Cultural Revolution,â€ he says. â€œBut then you look more into it, there are weeks of it gradually ramping up, and the attacks get more physical and their own mental state chipped away. â€ When Saxton began the Twitter account, he had no idea that it would be such a tumultuous year for politics in his country, the U. K. let alone the U. S. He is wary of drawing close parallels too, but he says it struck him how long it took Chinaâ€™s political elite to realize how bad the Cultural Revolution would get.   It can get worse. The Cultural Revolution officially ends in 1976. For now, Saxon says, heâ€™s committed to tweeting the whole thing."
73434,"Norway, like many European states, has public offerings many Americans would consider political fantasy. There is lengthy paid maternity leave, free university education, and   unemployment benefits. What is it about the Norwegian state â€”  or about Scandinavian countries in general â€”  that leads their populations to support redistribution policies in a way that Americans donâ€™t? A group of Scandinavian researchers recently did an experiment trying to tease that out. Their goal: to find out how social attitudes towards inequality in the U. S. and Norway differ, in an effort to explain why the two countries have such different redistribution policies. The difference, they discovered, hinges on how people think about luck and fairness. â€œIn Norway, people very much disapprove of inequalities that are due to bad luck,â€ Bertil Tungodden, a professor at the Norwegian School of Economics, and one of the paperâ€™s authors, told me. â€œPeople in the U. S. are more willing to accept inequality, even if it reflects pure good luck for some and pure bad luck for others. â€ The researchers recruited a group of Americans and Norwegians online to complete a series of simple tasks including putting together sentences, and told them theyâ€™d be paid a basic fee plus a bonus. A second group of Americans and Norwegians recruited online â€”  called spectators â€”  was then asked to oversee the distribution of bonuses. In one setting, spectators were told that the two workers had done the task equally well, but that, unless they intervened, one worker was going to get the whole bonus and the other worker was going to get no bonus. The spectators were then given the opportunity to redistribute the bonus more equally. In another setting, spectators were told that one worker had done the task better, and thus would get the whole bonus. Again, the spectators were given the chance to redistribute the bonuses. And in a third setting, spectators were told that both workers did the job equally well, and that one worker was going to get the bonus, but that if the spectators decided to redistribute the bonus, the amount available would be significantly reduced. The purpose of setting up the experiment this way, Tungodden told me, was to find out spectatorsâ€™ views about different sources of inequality. In the first setting, inequality was a result of luck: The workers both did the task well, but one just got lucky and received a bonus. In the second, inequality was a result of merit: One worker did the task better. And the third was to assess whether people were willing to eradicate inequality created by luck if doing so had costs: The bonus was lower if the spectators chose to redistribute it more fairly. In the experiment, Americans were more willing to accept inequality if itâ€™s a result of luck than Norwegians were. When both workers did the task well, but only one got the bonus (the first setting) half of Americans said they wanted to redistribute the bonus equally. By contrast, 78 percent of Norwegians did. â€œItâ€™s an enormous difference in exactly the same situation in a willingness to accept brute luck,â€ Tungodden said. â€œAmericans hold this view of, whatever comes to you, good for you. â€ When inequality was a result of merit, on the other hand, people in both countries were willing to accept it. Just 15 percent of people in the U. S. and 36 percent of people in Norway redistributed the bonus in the second situation. Together, this helps explain why Norway has a more robust welfare state than the U. S. does, Tungodden said. Norwegians believe that when someone is, by bad luck, born into a poor family, or is, by bad luck, thrust into poverty, that person should have help from others. U. S. residents are more split on this idea. This could be because Americans admire wealth and would be hesitant to implement policies that would hurt people who, by luck, are wealthy. There were some differences in which demographics in each country were willing to redistribute the bonuses. Conservatives in both countries accepted inequality (resulting from either chance or effort) and did not redistribute.   Americans were more meritocratic than   Americans, though in Norway, educational background did not make a difference in someoneâ€™s willingness to redistribute. Women in the United States were less likely to accept inequality resulting from either source, according to the experiment. The experiment did not look at questions of race, which may be one reason the countries have differing views on welfare. As Iâ€™ve written before, white Americans tend to be more withholding when it comes to welfare if they believe the money is going to black Americans. It would be illuminating for another, similar study to be performed that looks at whether white people perceive luck as more or less fair if the beneficiary (or loser, as the case may be) is black. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, both Americans and Norwegians seemed willing to weather some costs of wealth redistribution. In the third setting, when spectators were told that the inequality was the result of luck, but that redistributing the bonus would have a significant cost, about equal numbers of Americans and Norwegians decided to redistribute. About 58 percent of Americans decided to redistribute in the third setting, compared to 76 percent of Norwegians. This is significant, Tungodden says, because it shows that people in both countries are more concerned about whether inequalities are fair than about whether there are costs to redistribution. Debates about the costs of a welfare state and redistribution in America, then, may be besides the point. Costs donâ€™t seem to be Americansâ€™ big   with redistribution. Rather, their opposition seems to go to an underlying acceptance of fate and the fortunes it brings."
